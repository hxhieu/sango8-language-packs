{"id":28003,"original":"泰山鉅平人，曹魏重將，治軍嚴厲公正，五子良將中最受曹操器重。張繡叛變時，全軍混亂，唯獨于禁能約束部眾，並且先穩定戰況，再行回報，得到曹操讚賞：「將軍在亂能整，討暴堅壘，有不可動之節，雖古名將，何以加之！」。于禁舊友昌豨反叛被擊敗後，向其投降，但于禁以軍法公正處理，將昌豨處斬。樊城之戰中，關羽掘引漢水圍城，于禁不敵投降，晚節不保。曹丕更以壁畫羞辱于禁，致使于禁羞憤病逝。","text":"Taishan Giant Ping, Cao Wei heavy general, strict and fair management of the army, the five good generals are the most respected by Cao Cao. When Zhang Xiu rebelled, the whole army was in chaos. The only restriction was to restrain the troops, and first stabilize the battle, and then repay. This was praised by Cao Cao:  'The general is able to reconcile in chaos and fight for violence. Famous generals, why add them!'. After Yujin’s old friend, Changpin, was defeated in rebellion, he surrendered to him, but Yujin used military law to deal with him fairly and cut Changpin from the place. During the Battle of Fancheng, Guan Yu dug into the Han River to besiege the city, but lost to the ban and surrendered. Cao Pi even humiliated Jin with mural paintings, which led to Yu Jin's anger and death."}

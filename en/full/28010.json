When serving as an official in the Eastern Han Dynasty, he formed his own \"White Horse Yicong\" and led dozens of elite cavalry on white horses to fend off the enemy at the border. Under the tutelage of Lu Zhi, brother Liu Bei, he was described in the novel that he accepted Liu Bei as a general during Dong Zhuo's crusade. After the Kwantung Allied Forces disbanded, they disagreed with Yuan Shao and even attacked Liu Yu, starting the battle for power among the Kwantung Allied Forces. After leading the governor of Youzhou, he became more and more arrogant and indulged in treacherous trespasses, which led to deviations in the hearts of the people, and was finally besieged by Yuan Shao's army and retreated to Yijing. Although he tried to attack Yuan Shao with Zhang Yan, Yuan Shao saw through him and set up an ambush. After Gongsun Zan fell in the middle, knowing he would lose, he returned to the city and burned himself to death."}

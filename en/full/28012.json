In order to repay Kong Rong’s kindness to his mother, Tai Shici made a solitary ride to ask for help when Kong Rong was surrounded by the Yellow Turban army; while serving as Liu Yao, he fought with Sun Ce many times. Sun Ce appreciated his bravery. After defeating Liu Yao, he appointed him regardless of his predecessors. People, the heavy responsibility of the old Ministry of Zhao'an Liu You was handed over to him without hesitation. Tai Shici lived up to expectations and returned back faithfully. Cao Cao also admired and called surrenders many times, but Tai Shi Ci ignored it. After he died of illness before the Chibi War, Sun Quan also sighed."}

{"id":28014,"original":"魯國曲阜人，孔子後人，建安七子之一，自幼就有許多的逸事流傳，「孔融讓梨」、「小時了了」皆出自於孔融。董卓掌權時，懷恨屢次勸戒他的孔融，因此任命其為北海相，對抗黃巾軍。待曹操迎獻帝都許，孔融時常頂撞曹操，被曹操怨恨，尤以孔融上奏要恢復古制「宜准古王畿之制，千里寰內，不以封建諸侯」，犯了曹操大忌。最終曹操以孔融服喪期間行為不端，冠罪問斬，株連全家。孔融空有匡扶漢室之志，卻無軍事政治之才，一生並無顯著政績，但風骨可取。","text":"A native of Qufu of the Lu Kingdom, a descendant of Confucius, one of the seven sons of Jian'an, many anecdotes have been circulating since childhood. 'Kong Rong let pears' and 'It's getting young' all came from Kong Rong. When Dong Zhuo took power, he repeatedly persuaded his Kong Rong with a grudge, so he appointed him as Beihai Xiang to fight the Yellow Turban Army. When Cao Cao welcomes the Emperor's Capital Xu, Kong Rong often contradicts Cao Cao and is resented by Cao Cao. In particular, Kong Rong went on to restore the ancient system, 'The system of ancient kings should be used for a thousand miles, not feudal lords.' This violated Cao Cao's taboo. In the end, Cao Cao used Kong Rong for misbehavior during the mourning period, and the whole family was imprisoned. Kong Rongkong has the ambition to help the Han family, but he has no military and political talents. He has no significant political achievements in his life, but his character is good."}

Dong Zhuo's chaotic politics and the melee of warlords led to the Sanfu famine. Wang Zhong had no choice but to fill his hunger with human flesh, and was therefore not allowed to reuse it, and was even mocked by Cao Pi. In the novel, Wang Zhong and Liu Dai attacked Liu Bei and were defeated and captured. Liu Bei treated each other with courtesy and released him and Liu Dai. Cao Cao saw Wang Zhong and Liu Dai and wanted to put them accountable and put them to death. Kong Rong persuaded him to save his life."}

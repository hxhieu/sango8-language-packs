During the Battle of Shiting, he tried to capture Cao Xiu alive and captured Shouchun and Huainan, but Lu Xun did not use it. He attacked Cao Xiu in three separate ways, beheading ten thousand people, plundering ten thousand oxen, horses, carts and military equipment. Cao Wei’s Lujiang ruler accused Lu Xi’s rebellion. So Dongwu sent Quan Cong to lead the army. Zhu Huan followed, but his deeds were revealed and he withdrew his troops sadly. Because he was afraid of him, he did not dare to attack, which shows that Zhu Huan's prestige is prosperous."}

{"id":28053,"original":"清河國鄃縣人，曹魏名將，史載名聲只略遜於徐晃，緊追五子良將之後。初從韓馥，袁紹奪冀州後，歸於袁紹。曹操伐陶謙，朱靈奉袁紹之命增援曹操，因仰慕曹操，決定留在曹營。後曹操遣朱靈與劉備率軍阻截袁術北上，朱靈知劉備有異心而不報，縱虎歸山。官渡戰時，又因念及舊主袁紹，不願出兵，引起曹操猜忌，解除朱靈兵權，命于禁接管。袁室覆滅，朱靈才重獲曹操信任，參與大小戰役，主要功績多是作為副將，經略西北。曹丕即位後，頗為器重朱靈，官至後將軍，更少見的讓朱靈自選封地為高唐縣侯。","text":" A native of Yunxian County of Qinghe State, a famous general of Cao Wei, his historical reputation is only slightly inferior to Xu Huang, and he is closely following the five good generals. First from Han Fu, Yuan Shao returned to Yuan Shao after winning Jizhou. Cao Cao defeated Tao Qian, and Zhu Ling was ordered by Yuan Shao to reinforce Cao Cao. Because he admired Cao Cao, he decided to stay in Cao Ying. Later, Cao Cao sent Zhu Ling and Liu Bei to lead his army to stop Yuan Shu from going north. Zhu Ling knew that Liu Bei had different intentions and refused to report, and went back to the mountain. During the Guandu War, because of thinking about the old master Yuan Shao, he was unwilling to send troops, which caused Cao Cao's suspicion. When the Yuan room was destroyed, Zhu Lingcai regained the trust of Cao Cao and participated in large and small battles. His main achievements were mostly as a vice general, managing the northwest. After Cao Pi came to the throne, Zhu Ling was highly regarded. After the official came to the general, Zhu Ling chose to choose his fiefdom as Gaotang County."}

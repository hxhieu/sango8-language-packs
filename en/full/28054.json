{"id":28054,"original":"泰山郡南城縣人，西晉名將。姊為司馬師之妻。與東吳名將陸抗對峙多年，經營荊州初期不尚武力，在與陸抗爭戰失利後調整策略，修築城寨、擴大晉朝領土，對吳地軍民施以信義，於當地聲望極高。雖與陸抗長年對峙，兩人卻惺惺相惜，傳為千古佳話。病死前推舉杜預作為討吳接班，杜預也不負所望，成功滅吳。荊襄百姓對羊祜十分敬重，於襄陽立碑，祭拜羊公碑時無不落淚，故又稱其為墮淚碑。羊祜精擅文學，可惜著作傳世不多，「天下不如意，恆十居七八」，即出自羊祜。","text":" Nancheng County, Taishan County, a famous general in the Western Jin Dynasty. Sister is the wife of Master Sima. For many years, he confronted the famous Dongwu general Lu Kang. In the early stage of operating Jingzhou, he did not rely on force. After losing the battle with Lu, he adjusted his strategy, built walls, expanded the territory of the Jin Dynasty, and imposed good faith on the soldiers and civilians of Wu. Although confronted with Lu Kang for many years, the two of them cherished each other and passed them on as an eternal story. Before he died of illness, Du Yu was elected as Wu's successor, and Du Yu lived up to expectations and successfully eliminated Wu. People in Jingxiang respect Yanghu very much. They erected a stele in Xiangyang and shed tears when worshiping the stele of Yanggong, so it is also called the Monument of Fallen Tears. Yang Hu is good at literature, but unfortunately not many works have been handed down to the world. \"The world is not as good as it is, and it is always ten or seven or eight\", that is, Yang Hu."}

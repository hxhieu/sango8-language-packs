{"id":28061,"original":"并州五原郡九原人，曾為丁原、董卓之養子。三國時第一猛將，時人曰：「人中有呂布，馬中有赤兔。」王允設計，策反呂布刺殺董卓，而後李催等人依賈詡之計召董卓舊部攻陷長安，呂布敗走，輾轉投於袁術、袁紹。於曹操東征時襲奪兗州，被曹操擊敗後，又奪劉備所佔之徐州。最後被曹劉聯軍所滅，因劉備忌憚曹操得呂布恐橫掃宇內，復又恨呂布奪徐州之仇，出言勸曹操斬殺呂布。呂布聲名既盛，爭議亦多。然能納陳宮為己用，又得高順、張遼等虎將效忠，確實有過人之處。而嘗為丁原主簿，當識書曉文，非無知莽漢。","text":"A native of Jiuyuan, Wuyuan County, Bingzhou, was the adopted son of Ding Yuan and Dong Zhuo. The first fierce general in the Three Kingdoms period, the people said:  'There is Lv Bu among the people, and there are Red Rabbits among the horses.' Wang Yun designed and instigated Lv Bu to assassinate Dong Zhuo, and then Li Cui and others summoned Dong Zhuo's old army to capture Chang'an and Lv Bu according to Jia Xu's plan. After losing, he moved to Yuan Shu and Yuan Shao. During the Eastern Expedition of Cao Cao, he captured Yanzhou. After being defeated by Cao Cao, he seized Xuzhou occupied by Liu Bei. Finally, he was wiped out by the Cao and Liu coalition forces. Because Liu Bei was afraid of Cao Cao, Cao Cao was afraid of sweeping Yu Nei, and he hated Lü Bu for taking the hatred of Xuzhou, and spoke out to persuade Cao Cao to kill Lü Bu. Lu Bu has a great reputation and controversy. However, being able to take Chen Palace for his own use, and having the allegiance of tiger generals such as Gao Shun and Zhang Liao, is indeed extraordinary. And tasted as Ding Yuan's master book, as a book and Xiaowen, not an ignorant man."}

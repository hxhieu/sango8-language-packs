Lu Bu, Zhang Xiu, and Yuan Shao all fought with Cao Cao in the battle. Cao Ren served as a lieutenant when he attacked the new field, but the night attack strategy was seen through by Xu Shu, then Liu Bei's army division, and was defeated. Later, he became the deputy general of Xiahoudun. He saw Liu Beijun's intentions and advised Xiahoudun not to advance, but he was not accepted. Xiahoudun was defeated by Zhuge Liang's fire attack, and Li Dian struggled to rescue him and was able to escape. After the Battle of Chibi, he defended Hefei with Zhang Liao and Le Jin. Although not in harmony with Zhang Liao, he was able to put aside his prejudices in the battle of Xiaoyaojin, cooperate with Zhang Liao and fight against Sun Quan, which showed his grandeur."}

{"id":28087,"original":"演義所杜撰虛構之人物，史實無記載。為東漢零陵太守劉度麾下猛將，號稱可力敵萬人，與劉度之子劉賢一同迎戰來攻零陵的諸葛亮。邢道榮被諸葛亮用計擊敗後詐降，虛以委蛇表示願做內應，實則與劉賢設伏暗算劉備軍。但此計早被諸葛亮識破，最終被趙雲所殺。","text":"There is no historical record of a fictional character invented by the Romance. Liu Du, the prefect of Lingling of the Eastern Han Dynasty, was a fierce general under the command of Lingling. He was known to be able to fight against 10,000 people. He and Liu Xian, son of Liu Du, faced Zhuge Liang who came to attack Lingling. After being defeated by Zhuge Liang, Xing Daorong surrendered, falsely surrendering to the snake and expressing his willingness to respond internally, but in fact set up an ambush with Liu Xian against Liu Beijun. However, Zhuge Liang saw through this plan long ago and was eventually killed by Zhao Yun."}

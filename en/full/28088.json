{"id":28088,"original":"陳留尉氏人，「竹林七賢」之一。少時學儒，本有經濟大志，但時運不佳、世局混亂，鬱鬱不得志。後漸從老莊之流，「忘世慮於形骸之外，托興於酗酒，以樂終身之志」。司馬昭曾想為兒子司馬炎求娶阮籍女，阮籍連續醉酒六十多日，司馬昭找不到提出求親的機會，只得作罷。奇異行徑極多，母喪時不按照一般禮俗，仍然喝酒吃肉，卻因悲傷而在下葬時吐血數升。亦常常獨自駕車，漫無目的出遊，直到無路可走，痛哭而折返，最終得以年壽終。","text":"Chen Liuwei, one of the \"seven sages of the bamboo forest\". Studying Confucianism when I was young had great economic ambitions, but the fortunes were bad, the world was chaotic, and he was depressed. Later, he gradually moved from Lao Zhuang and his ilk, \"worrying about the world and worrying about the corpse, encouraged by alcoholism, and enjoying lifelong ambition.\" Sima Zhao once wanted to marry a daughter of Ruan Ji for his son Sima Yan. Ruan Ji had been drunk for more than 60 days. Sima Zhao could not find a chance to ask for marriage and had to give up. There are many bizarre acts. The mother did not follow the general customs during the funeral. She still drank and ate meat, but because of grief, she vomited blood for several liters during the funeral. I often drive alone and travel aimlessly until there is nowhere to go, crying and turning back, and finally end of life."}

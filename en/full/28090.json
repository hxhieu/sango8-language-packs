{"id":28090,"original":"正史未記載，出自於《三國演義》和鄉野誌。曾是張寶麾下武將，黃巾軍失勢後，於臥牛山從事山賊勾當時遇見關羽，投效關羽，征戰四方。於樊城與于禁、龐德等曹操將領交戰，並在水中擒得落船之龐德。在關羽敗走麥城被孫權斬殺後，周倉追隨其主刎頸而死。原形是來自於魯肅向關羽要求歸還荊州時，出言駁斥魯肅的一名護衛。","text":" Undocumented in the official history, from \"The Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" and Country Records. Once a general under Zhang Bao's command, after the Yellow Turbans lost power, he met Guan Yu when he was engaged in bandit hooking in Wo Niu Mountain, and he joined Guan Yu and fought in all directions. Yu Fancheng fought against Cao Cao generals such as Yu Jin and Pound, and captured Pound in the water. After Guan Yu defeated Maicheng and beheaded by Sun Quan, Zhou Cang followed his master and died. The original form comes from a guard who refuted Lu Su when Lu Su asked Guan Yu to return Jingzhou."}

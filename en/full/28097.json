{"id":28097,"original":"司隸右扶風人，原為劉璋幕僚，但不受重用，後仕從劉備，為劉備入蜀後最受仰賴的謀臣。與張松等人合謀將益州獻予劉備，又和龐統同任軍師，助劉備取得益州。劉備得蜀後，與諸葛亮、伊籍、劉巴、李嚴共同制定「蜀科」，以法治蜀。曹劉相爭漢中，也因法正出謀畫策，使黃忠得以擊殺曹魏大將夏侯淵，更令曹操興嘆：「吾收奸雄略盡，獨不得正邪！」法正睚眥必報、錙銖計較，然智謀奇計百出，尤重恩情，曾不惜以身為劉備擋箭，深受劉備、諸葛亮的重用與讚賞。可惜法正早亡，劉備頓失棟樑，夷陵大敗後，諸葛亮便因此感嘆：「法孝直若在，則能制主上，令不東行；就復東行，必不傾危矣。」","text":"Sili Youfufeng was originally Liu Zhang’s staff, but he was not reusable. Later he was from Liu Bei and he was Liu Bei’s most trusted adviser after he entered Shu. Conspired with Zhang Song and others to dedicate Yizhou to Liu Bei, and served as a military division with Pang Tong to help Liu Bei obtain Yizhou. After Liu Bei obtained Shu, he worked with Zhuge Liang, Yi Ji, Liu Ba, and Li Yan to formulate the 'Shu Branch' to govern Shu by law. Cao and Liu fought against Hanzhong, and because of the law, Huang Zhong was able to kill Cao Wei general Xia Houyuan, and Cao Cao sighed:  'I will collect all the traitors and heroes, but I will not be righteous and evil!' However, he has a lot of wit and ingenuity, especially the kindness, and he did not hesitate to use Liu Bei as a defense against arrows, and was deeply reused and appreciated by Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang. It's a pity that the Fa is dying early, and Liu Beidun lost his pillars. After Yiling's defeat, Zhuge Liang sighed:  'If the filial piety of the law exists, you can control the Lord and prevent you from going east; if you go back to the east, you will not be in danger.'"}

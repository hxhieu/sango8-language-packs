Once suggested that Yuan Shao take the emperor and command the princes, Yuan Shao did not want to be restrained by the emperor, so that Cao Cao seized the opportunity. Jushou also opposed Yuan Shao's letting his three sons own a state. After Yuan Shao's death, the three sons really fought for power. Jushou and Tian Feng persuaded Yuan Shao to rest and recuperate, and not to be arrogant. Yuan Shao not only ignored them, but also alienated the two. During the Guandu War, he pointed out that Yan Liang was not suitable for leading the army alone, Yuan Shao refused, and Yan Liang was beheaded in the battle. He also advised that Yuan Jun should stay in Yanjin and divide the army into the official crossing, but still not accepted. Jushou reluctantly called the disease, Yuan Shao angrily released his military power. After being defeated and captured, Cao Cao loved his talents and treated him favorably. He even said, 'We can get each other early, and the world is not worried about it.' However, Jushou insisted on not surrendering, and was eventually condemned for plotting to flee."}

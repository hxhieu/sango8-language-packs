The official history records are self-contradictory, one said that Liu was descended, and the other was that Liu Bei died of attacking Wuling. In the romance, when Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei to attack Wuling, Jin Xuan ignored his subordinate Gong Zhi’s suggestion to surrender the city and decided to take the battle himself. When Zhang Fei was defeated and wanted to return to the city, he found that the city had been taken and Gong Zhi was on the wall. He accused 'When you are not in the sky, you will lose yourself, and I and the people will surrender Liu Yun.' Then he was shot to death by a flying arrow, and the first stage was dedicated to Zhang Fei."}

{"id":28101,"original":"涼州天水郡冀縣人，初為魏將，後降蜀漢，繼費禕後總領蜀漢軍權，是蜀漢後期的重要將領。姜維統領蜀漢軍事後，前後共計十一次北伐未果，部分史家認為蜀漢「國小民勞，不宜黷武」，直指蜀漢因此早早敗亡。但蜀漢以蕞爾小國，除待良機舉兵，以戰止戰外，殊無良策。姜維舉措，不能謂之過也。蜀亡後，姜維假降鍾會，意欲挑撥鍾會與鄧艾反目，最後死於兵變中。演義中多添筆墨，描述為諸葛亮傳人。","text":" A native of Jixian County, Tianshui County, Liangzhou. He was a general of Wei at first, then descended to the Shu Han. After Fei Yi, he commanded the military power of the Shu Han and was an important general in the late Shu Han. After Jiang Wei ruled the Shu Han military, a total of eleven Northern Expeditions were unsuccessful. Some historians believed that the Shu Han was \"a small country and the people worked hard, and it is not suitable for military use.\" They pointed out that the Shu Han was defeated early. However, the Shu Han had nothing to do with the small country, apart from waiting for a good opportunity to raise troops and ending the war with war. Jiang Wei's move cannot be overstated. After the death of Shu, Jiang Wei falsely dropped the bell meeting, intending to provoke the bell meeting with Deng Ai, and finally died in a mutiny. Add more pen and ink to the novel, describing it as the successor of Zhuge Liang."}

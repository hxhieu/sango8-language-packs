He was ordered to conquer the Yellow Turban Army and won many battles and achieved fruitful results. He even defeated Zhang Liang, which caused the Yellow Turban Army to collapse. Huangfu Song did not take credit for his uprightness, and attributed the credit to Zhu Jun for pacifying the three counties; he did not forget to fight for innocence for Lu Zhi. However, because he refused to bribe the eunuch, he was dismissed. Huangfusong held military power several times and became famous when the Han Dynasty declined, but he was still loyal to the Han Dynasty. At that time, Yan Zhong persuaded him to stand on his own feet, but Huangfu Song strictly refused. He was jealous and hated by Dong Zhuo because of his outstanding military exploits and repeated obstacles to Dong Zhuo's support. When Dong Zhuo was under the dictatorship, he was almost killed. When Wang Yun killed Dong Zhuo, Huangfu Song also responded and led his troops to Yinwu to destroy the Dong Zhuoyu clan."}

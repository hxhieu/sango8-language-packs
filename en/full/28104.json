{"id":28104,"original":"袁術帳下勇將，正史中記載多散見於他人傳記中。演義中出身山東，慣使三尖兩刃刀，與關羽單挑三十回合，不分勝負。率軍進攻屯駐小沛的劉備，呂布以轅門射戟，調停兩軍，此事跡載於正史，非演義杜撰。仲家敗亡後，與袁術一同北上，在投靠袁紹的途中遭劉備軍的阻截，在單挑中敗於張飛手下。","text":"Yuan Shu is a brave general under the account. The official history records are scattered in the biography of others. Born in Shandong, he used to use a three-pointed two-edged sword to compete against Guan Yu for 30 rounds, regardless of the outcome. Leading the army to attack Liu Bei, who was stationed in Xiaopei, Lu Bu shot a halberd at the gate to mediate the two armies. This deed is recorded in the official history and is not a fantasy. After the defeat of the Zhong family, they went north with Yuan Shu, and were blocked by Liu Beijun on their way to seek refuge in Yuan Shao, and lost to Zhang Fei in a heads-up."}

{"id":28107,"original":"史書僅提及他與范彊聯手刺殺張飛，隨後投奔東吳，之後再無下文。演義中，在關羽死後，張飛為替關羽弔喪，限范彊、張達三日內趕造白盔白甲，二人請求寬延期限，張飛不許，鞭打並揚言斬殺二人。二人憤恨無以，又恐懼被張飛所殺，遂趁張飛酣睡時割下首級，投奔東吳。孫權為避免戰事加劇，將二人押回蜀漢，被張飛之子張苞凌遲。","text":"The history book only mentions that he and Fan Qiang jointly assassinated Zhang Fei, and then defected to Soochow. In the novel, after Guan Yu's death, Zhang Fei, in order to mourn Guan Yu, restricted Fan Qiang and Zhang Da to build white helmets and white armor within three days. The two requested a grace period, but Zhang Fei would not allow him to flog and threaten to kill them. The two were indignant and fearful of being killed by Zhang Fei, so they cut off the head when Zhang Fei was sleeping, and went to Soochow. In order to avoid the intensification of the fighting, Sun Quan escorted the two back to the Han Dynasty, and was delayed by Zhang Bao, the son of Zhang Fei."}

{"id":28114,"original":"沛國譙縣人，曹魏名將，曹操從兄弟。隨曹操起兵，和呂布交戰時，遭流矢射中左眼，因而瞽目，演義中重筆著墨成「拔矢啖睛」。此後因殘疾被稱為盲夏侯，夏侯惇極厭惡此一說法。於諸將中最得曹操信任，「召惇常與同載，特見親重，出入臥內，諸將莫得比也」。演義中多為統兵出征的猛將形象，實則好學清儉，治軍嚴謹，且更擅於內政後勤，長年為曹操鎮守後方。","text":" Peiguo Qiaoxian, famous general Cao Wei, brother Cao Cao. Following Cao Cao's army, he was shot in the left eye by Liu Ya during the battle with Lu Bu. Later, he was called blind Xiahou because of his disability, and Xiahou Dun hated this statement. Among the generals, Cao Cao trusted the most. \"Zhao Dun is often with the same load, and he is very close to each other. When going in and out of the sleeping room, the generals are Modbi.\" Most of the heroes in the romance show the image of a warrior who leads the army. In fact, he is eager to learn and frugal, rigorously manage the army, and is better at internal affairs and logistics. He has guarded the rear for Cao Cao for many years."}

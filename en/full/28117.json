{"id":28117,"original":"魏國武將，夏侯尚之兄。史實無記載，為演義所虛構的人物。漢中攻防戰時駐守天蕩山，天盪山乃屯糧之所，舉足輕重。當黃忠領軍來戰時本欲以逸待勞嚴守，沒料到蜀軍士氣高昂直接殺上山，後方糧草又被嚴顏點火燒起，魏軍大亂。夏侯德慌急提兵救火時，被嚴顏斬殺。","text":"General Wei, the brother of Xia Houshang. There is no record of historical facts, and a character made up by Yanyi. Hanzhong was stationed at Tiandang Mountain during the offensive and defensive war. Tiandang Mountain is the place where food is collected and plays a decisive role. When Huang Zhong led the army to the war, he wanted to wait for his work and guard strictly, but he did not expect that the morale of the Shu army was high and went straight to the mountain. The grain and grass in the rear were set on fire again and the Wei army was in chaos. Xiahoude was beheaded by Yan Yan when he hurriedly sent troops to fight the fire."}

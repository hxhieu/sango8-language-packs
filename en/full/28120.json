At that time, Sun Wei, the power minister of the State of Wu, was in power, and Sun Xiu secretly united Zhang Bu, one of the four great families in Jiangdong, and Ding Feng, among the twelve tiger officials, to successfully regain power. After that, Sun Xiu tried his best to rule and even took advantage of Wei State's destruction of Shu, intending to attack the land of no master, but he failed because Luo Xian, the last loyal minister of the Shu Han, blocked it.

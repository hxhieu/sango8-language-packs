{"id":28125,"original":"吳郡富春縣人，孫策、孫權之父。初以征伐黃巾有功而聞名。董卓亂政時，響應討董，歸於袁術麾下，表為破虜將軍。諸侯懼董卓軍勢大，裹足不前，孫堅孤軍進擊。其間於魯陽計退數萬董卓軍、二度挫敗呂布，更陣斬華雄，迫使董卓求親議和，但孫堅嚴詞拒絕，舉兵奮進，終將董卓逐出洛陽。孫堅入洛陽，偶得傳國玉璽，袁術有稱帝之意，知悉後便劫持孫堅妻子，逼迫孫堅交出玉璽，孫堅不得不從。後孫堅奉袁術之命討伐劉表，劉表派黃祖率軍抵抗，黃祖被孫堅大破，孫堅追渡漢水，圍襄陽，孫堅追擊黃祖入峴山，為黃祖軍士所射殺。演義中為顯關羽之勇，嫁接孫堅戰果，實為不公，讀史者不可不知究竟。","text":"A native of Fuchun County, Wujun, father of Sun Ce and Sun Quan. At first he was famous for his meritorious service in conquering the Yellow Turban. During Dong Zhuo's chaotic politics, he responded to the request of Dong and was attributed to Yuan Shu's command, and he was represented as a general of the impoverished army. The princes were afraid that Dong Zhuo's army would be strong, and he stopped, and Sun Jian attacked alone. In the meantime, Luyang retreated tens of thousands of Dong Zhuojun, defeated Lu Bu for the second time, and slashed Huaxiong to force Dong Zhuo to ask for peace, but Sun Jian sternly refused, put his troops forward, and eventually expelled Dong Zhuo from Luoyang. When Sun Jian entered Luoyang, he occasionally heard the jade seal of the country. Yuan Shu had the intention to claim the emperor. After learning about it, he hijacked Sun Jian's wife and forced Sun Jian to hand over the jade seal. Sun Jian had to follow. Later Sun Jian was ordered by Yuan Shu to defeat Liu Biao. Liu Biao sent Huang Zu to resist. Huang Zu was broken by Sun Jian. Sun Jian chased across Han River and surrounded Xiangyang. Sun Jian chased Huang Zu into Xian Mountain and was shot and killed by Sergeant Huang Zu. To show Guan Yu's courage in the novel, grafting Sun Jian's battle results is really unfair. Those who read history must know the truth."}

Sun Deng was filial to his parents, courteous corporal, caring for the people, and had a good relationship with Soochow General Lu Xun. He was very loved by Sun Quan. Sun Quan would rather go to war with Cao Pi than let Sun Deng go to Cao Wei as a hostage. Unfortunately, he died at the age of thirty-three. Before his death, Sun published a letter to Sun Quan, admonishing state affairs and recommending virtuous officials. His morality and talents are rare. After Sun Deng's death, although Sun Quan established Sun He as the prince, but he loved Lu Wang and Sun Ba, so that the Second Palace dispute broke out."}

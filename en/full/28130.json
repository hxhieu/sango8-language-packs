In the Battle of Shiting, Cao Xiu led the army to attack Dongwu. He once advised Cao Xiu not to go deep, but Cao Xiu insisted on marching, leading to defeat. During Cao Rui's reign, Sun Li remonstrated with great efforts in civil engineering, but Cao Rui also conscripted for civil labor. Sun Li stopped work without playing the order. Cao Rui knew that Sun Li was careful, and ultimately did not inquire. When Sun Wu Quancong came, Sun Li personally led troops to resist and fought bravely. In the dispute between Pingyuan and Qinghe counties, Cao Shuang was offended for bluntly. He was punished and demoted to the rank of captain of the city gate. It was not until the change of Gaopingling that he was reused."}

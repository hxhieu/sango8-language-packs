{"id":28132,"original":"河東郡楊縣人，魏國名將，五子良將之一。曹操迎獻帝後，投入曹操陣營。徐晃隨曹操征伐，官渡戰中，擊敗顏良，攻克白馬，進軍延津，擊殺文醜，功居魁首。北征烏桓，又大敗蹋頓。西涼馬超反叛，徐晃破馬超前部，令曹軍得以立營紮寨。為解救樊城之圍，以聲東擊西之計大敗關羽，曹操於徐晃凱旋後巡營，見徐晃軍容嚴整，盛讚其善領兵，有周亞夫之風。史書中另有記載，徐晃與關羽出身同郡，結為知己，樊城之戰中，兩人遙對敘舊，不及軍事，回陣後才下軍令。演義中杜撰徐晃在隨司馬懿征孟達時，被孟達射殺。","text":"A native of Yang County, Hedong County, a famous general in Wei State, one of the five good generals. Cao Cao welcomes the Empress and joins Cao Cao's camp. Xu Huang followed Cao Cao's conquest. In the Guandu battle, he defeated Yan Liang, conquered the white horse, marched into Yanjin, killed Wen Chou, and took the lead. The northern conquest of Wuhuan was defeated again. Xiliang Ma Chao rebelled, and Xu Huang broke the front of the horse, allowing Cao Jun to set up camp. In order to save the siege of Fancheng, he defeated Guan Yu with the tactic of attacking the east and the west. Cao Cao patrolled the camp after Xu Huang's triumphant triumph. He saw Xu Huang's army rigorously and praised him for his good leadership and Zhou Yafu's style. There is another record in the history books that Xu Huang and Guan Yu were born in the same county and became confidantes. In the Battle of Fancheng, the two recounted the past and were not as good as the military. They only issued military orders after returning to the battle. It is invented in the novel that Xu Huang was shot and killed by Mengda while accompanying Sima Yi to conquer Mengda."}

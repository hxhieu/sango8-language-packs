{"id":28135,"original":"幽州遼東襄平人，一說玄菟人。徐榮為董卓軍大將，官拜中郎將，然三國志和後漢書中皆未為其立傳，僅能從他人傳記的字裡行間中擷取幾分崢嶸。徐榮畢生有兩大戰績，其一於汴水之戰中大敗曹操，幾令曹軍覆沒，曹操更險些被擒殺於此役中。其二，梁東之戰大戰孫堅。彼時孫堅斬華雄、破呂布，聲勢無二，兵鋒直指洛陽，卻慘敗在徐榮手下。董卓死後，徐榮歸順朝廷，董卓舊部李傕、郭汜等西涼軍閥納賈詡計策，舉兵包圍長安。徐榮受司徒王允的命令與胡軫出戰，然胡軫已私通李傕，徐榮獨木難支，死於新豐之戰。","text":"People from Xiangping, Liaodong, Youzhou, said Xuantu people. Xu Rong was the general of Dong Zhuojun, and the official worshiped the general of Zhonglang. However, there was no biography for him in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the Later Han, and he could only extract a little from the lines of the biographies of others. Xu Rong had two great achievements in his life. One was defeated Cao Cao in the Battle of Bianshui. Cao Cao was wiped out several times, and Cao Cao was almost captured and killed in this battle. Second, the battle of Liangdong fought against Sun Jian. At that time, Sun Jian slashed Huaxiong and broke Lu Bu, with the same momentum. The soldiers pointed directly at Luoyang, but they were defeated by Xu Rong. After Dong Zhuo's death, Xu Rong returned to the court, and the Xiliang warlord Najaxu, including Li Yu and Guo Bang, of Dong Zhuo's old tribe, encircled Chang'an with troops. Xu Rong was ordered by Situ Wang Yun to fight with Hu Zhen. However, Hu Zhen had fornicated with Li Yu, and Xu Rong was unable to support himself and died in the battle of Xinfeng."}

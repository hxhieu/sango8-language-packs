Yuan clan was the famous gate of the four generations and three males, and was used by He Jin together with Yuan Shu. After He Jin was killed by an eunuch, the two went into the palace to kill the eunuch. Later, he became the leader of the anti-Dong Zhuo coalition. After the anti-Dong alliance was disbanded, he defeated Han Fu, Gongsun Zan, Kong Rong, Zhang Yan and others, controlled Qing, Ji, You, and the four states, and dominated Hebei. When Emperor Xian went out, because he did not want to be restrained by the Han Dynasty, he missed the opportunity to welcome the emperor. Tian Feng persuaded Yuan Shao to attack the rear when Cao Cao attacked Liu Bei. Yuan Shao refused on the grounds that the child was sick and missed the opportunity again. Yuan Shao was so indecisive and refused to accept the words of counselors such as Tian Feng, Jushou, and Xu You, so that he was defeated in the battle of Guandu and his vitality was greatly injured. He was defeated again in the battle of Cangting and died in Jizhou. Because of the separation of three sons during his lifetime, the three sons seized the right to fight for the right, and they were defeated by Cao Cao."}

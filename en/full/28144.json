He joined the army for less time, repeatedly made military exploits, and was promoted to general, guarding Hexi for more than 40 years, and admiring Sanhu. After the Battle of Jie Ting, Cao Zhen believed that Zhuge Liang would attack Chen Cang and sent Hao Zhao and Wang Sheng to guard Chen Cang and build Chen Cang City. Later Zhuge Liang led an army to attack Chen Cang, and Hao Zhao stood firm. The Shu army used all means to attack the city, dig tunnels, and set up a ladder to drive vehicles, but they failed to overcome it. Hao Zhao insisted on staying in Chencang for more than twenty days, until Wei Guo’s reinforcements rushed forward, and Zhuge Liang saw hopelessness to break the city and had to retreat. After the war, Hao Zhao was named a Marquis, but died soon after."}

{"id":28152,"original":"司隸右扶風人，馬騰長子，演義中蜀國五虎將之一。馬超在羌胡中威名卓著，時稱：「超有信、布之勇，甚得羌、胡心」，曹操亦忌憚馬超勇武：「馬兒不死，吾無葬地也。」演義中為凸顯蜀漢滿朝忠義，顛倒馬超反曹因果。正史載馬超不顧馬騰在朝為官，同韓遂起兵，雖初戰告捷，但之後接連兵敗，只得遣使議和。賈詡又使反間計令馬、韓內鬨，曹軍趁機猛攻，大敗之。曹操班師回朝後，才因馬超叛逆，處斬馬騰。再次起兵，又被楊阜、趙昂及其妻王異等人設計，敗逃後投奔張魯。張魯器重馬超，一度想將女兒嫁給他，但思及馬超不顧馬騰劣跡在先而作罷。後馬超覺得無法和張魯共謀大事，又密書劉備投降，投靠劉備後，受到重用，官至驃騎將軍。","text":"Si Li Youfu Feng, the eldest son of Ma Teng, one of the five tigers in the Kingdom of Shu. Ma Chao was well-known in Qiang and Hu Zhong, when he said:  'Super faithful and brave, so Qiang, Hu Xin', Cao Cao also feared Ma Chao bravely:  'The horse does not die, and I have no burial place.' Shuhan Manchu loyalty and righteousness reversed Ma Chao and Cao Karma. According to the official history, Ma Chao, regardless of Ma Teng's appointment as an official in the DPRK, joined forces with Han Sui. Although he succeeded in the first battle, he was defeated in succession and had to send envoys to negotiate a peace. Jia Xu made a counter-plan and Han Nei coaxed, and Cao Jun took the opportunity to storm and defeated him. After Cao Cao's class returned to the court, he cut Ma Teng because of Ma Chao's rebellion. The army was raised again, and it was designed by Yang Fu, Zhao Ang and his wife Wang Yi and others, and fled to Zhang Lu. Zhang Lu puts great emphasis on Ma Chao, and once wanted to marry his daughter to him, but thought that Ma Chao ignored Ma Teng's bad deeds and gave up. Hou Ma Chao felt that he could not conspire with Zhang Lu, so he secretly wrote that Liu Bei surrendered and took refuge in Liu Beihou. He was reused and became the official Hussar General."}

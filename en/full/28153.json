{"id":28153,"original":"襄陽宜城人，馬良之弟。馬謖頗具才氣，好論計謀用兵，深得諸葛亮賞識，劉備善識人，臨終前告訴諸葛亮：「馬謖言過其實，不可大用。」諸葛亮南征孟獲，馬謖建議：「攻心為上，攻城為下；心戰為上，兵將為下」，孟獲歸降後，直至蜀漢亡國，南疆未曾有過大戰。諸葛亮一出祁山，命馬謖守要地街亭。馬謖自認居高臨下可勢如破竹，捨棄水源，上山布陣，卻不知此乃自陷絕地，被張郃率軍圍困，掐斷糧道，因而大敗。街亭失守，諸葛亮不得不退返漢中，為穩定軍心，信賞罰，揮淚斬馬謖。","text":"Xiangyang Yicheng native, brother of Ma Liang. Ma Di is quite talented, good at strategy and use of troops, and won Zhuge Liang's appreciation. Liu Bei knows people well, and tells Zhuge Liang before his death:  'Ma Di exaggerates, not to be used.' Zhuge Liang conquered Meng Huo south, and Ma Di suggested:  'The heart is the first, the attack is the next. The battle of the heart is the top, the soldiers will be the bottom.' After Meng Huo returned, until the fall of the Shu Han, there was no great war in southern Xinjiang. When Zhuge Liang left Qishan, he ordered Ma Di to guard the important street pavilion. Ma Di believes that he is condescending to be like a broken bamboo, abandoning the water source, and going up the mountain to form an array, but he does not know that this is a self-trapped Jedi, besieged by Zhang Yun's army, cut off the food road, and thus defeated. When Jie Ting was lost, Zhuge Liang had to retreat to Hanzhong."}

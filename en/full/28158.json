{"id":28158,"original":"呂布麾下猛將。帶兵紀律嚴明、勇猛善戰，三國時人王粲所著《英雄記》中，盛讚高順所率親兵為「陷陣營」。高順雖然有能忠誠，但因直陳呂布缺點：「凡破家亡國，非無忠臣明智者也，但患不見用耳。將軍舉動，不肯詳思，輒喜言誤，誤不可數也」，令呂布不喜。後曹操於下邳平定呂布，高順也隨之遭擒，被下令絞殺。高順畢生忠於呂布，卻不受呂布待見。呂布知其能，而不能善任，又不聽肺腑之言，無怪乎窮途末路。","text":"Lu Bu's commander. Leading troops are disciplined, brave and good at fighting. In the 'Heroes' written by Wang Can, a member of the Three Kingdoms period, Gao Shun's troops were praised for being 'in the camp.' Although Gao Shun has the ability to be loyal, he confided in Lu Bu's shortcomings:  'Anyone who breaks his family and perishes the country is not without a loyal minister and a wise man, but he does not use his ears when he is in trouble. The general's actions are unwilling to think about it, and he may make mistakes in his words. The mistakes are uncountable.' , Lv Bu is not happy. After Cao Cao put down Lu Bu at Xiapi, Gao Shun was also captured and ordered to be strangled. Gao Shun was loyal to Lu Bu all his life, but he was not seen by Lu Bu. Lu Bu knew what he was capable of, but couldn't do well, and he didn't listen to what he said from the bottom of his heart. No wonder he was dead."}

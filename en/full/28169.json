Because Sun Ce personally went to the door to seek talents, he was highly regarded, and Zhang Zhao handled almost all internal affairs. Before Sun Ce died, he entrusted a lone to Zhang Zhao:  'If Zhongmou doesn't do anything, he will take it for himself.' However, Zhang Zhao was arrogant and often scolded Sun Quan and his colleagues, and his words were sharp and at odds with many people. However, Zhang Zhao tended to steadily avoid wars with foreign attackers. Before the Chibi War, he advocated peace and disagreed with Sun Quan, Zhou Yu, Lu Su and others. Zhang Zhao has a strong personality, and Sun Quan and the officials resented him; he was timid to fight outside and made no achievements. Although he was a veteran and important minister, he had not been promoted in his life."}

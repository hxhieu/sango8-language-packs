{"id":28173,"original":"幽州涿郡人，蜀國上將。演義與話本中杜撰其與劉備、關羽桃園結義，史料卻未有載；另，本字益德，毛本中改為翼德，與其名「飛」呼應。以勇猛著稱，與關羽並稱「萬人敵」，長坂坡喝阻曹操大軍、義釋嚴顏、大敗張郃，功勛顯赫。但於夷陵戰前，因刑罰過度，被帳下將領張達、范彊懷恨刺殺，更梟首送向東吳。近來多有稱張飛善書畫、美姿容、好謀略，但以上所謂史料多出於明代。明距三國已久，明人又好做偽以附庸風流，當不足以採信。","text":" Youzhou Zhuojun, general of Shu. In the Romance and Storybook, it was fabricated that it was associated with Liu Bei and Guan Yu Taoyuan, but the historical materials did not contain it; in addition, the original word Yide was changed to Yide in the Mao version, which echoes the name \"Fei\". Known for his bravery, he and Guan Yu were also called \"the enemy of ten thousand people.\" Chang Banpo blocked Cao Cao's army, righteous Yan Yan, and defeated Zhang Yun. However, before the Yiling War, due to excessive punishment, he was assassinated by generals Zhang Da and Fan Qiang, and sent him to Soochow first. Recently, Zhang Feishan has been called painting and calligraphy, beautiful appearance, good strategy, but the above so-called historical materials are mostly from the Ming Dynasty. Ming has been a long time since the Three Kingdoms, and Ming people are so good to be a vassal, but they are not enough to believe."}

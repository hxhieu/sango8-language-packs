{"id":28174,"original":"徐州廣陵郡人。東吳重臣、文學家，其文采便連建安七子的陳琳，亦自謙不如。演藝中僅以寥寥數字提及張紘，淪為張昭附庸，但史實上，張紘影響東吳命脈甚鉅。孫策在江都求策張紘，張紘獻計，此計便是催生了東吳的「江都對」。孫策遇刺身亡時，曹操欲奪取江東，也因張紘諫阻，而放棄出兵。孫權承襲孫策之位，奉張紘為元老，尤為倚重，稱帝後仍敬稱張紘為東部，而不直呼其名。張紘為東吳畢其心力，臨終前仍惦記國事，在遺書中仔細叮囑，其中「忠臣挾難進之術，吐逆耳之言，其不合也，不亦宜乎」、「故明君寤之，求賢如饑渴，受諫而不厭。」，對比孫權晚年所作所為和東吳後勢，更是讓人不禁佩服張紘的遠見。","text":"People from Guangling County, Xuzhou. An important minister and writer of the Eastern Wu, his literary talent was even inferior to Chen Lin, the Seventh Son of Jian'an. In the performing arts, Zhang Hong was mentioned in only a few figures, and he became a vassal of Zhang Zhao, but in fact, Zhang Hong had a huge influence on the lifeline of Dongwu. Sun Ce sought advice from Zhang Hong in Jiangdu, and Zhang Hong offered a plan. This plan gave birth to the 'Jiangdu Right' of Soochow. When Sun Ce was assassinated and killed, Cao Cao wanted to capture Jiangdong, but because of Zhang Hong's advice, he gave up sending troops. Sun Quan inherited the throne of Sun Ce, appointing Zhang Hong as the veteran, and especially relied on him. The empress still respected Zhang Hong as the east instead of calling his name directly. Zhang Hong worked hard for the Eastern Wu. Before he died, he was still thinking about the affairs of the country. He carefully reminded him in his suicide note. Among them, 'the loyal ministers are difficult to enter, and utter words that are incompatible with the ears.' Seeking talents is hungry and thirsty, and insatiable after admonition.” Comparing Sun Quan's behavior in his later years and the future of Soochow, people can't help but admire Zhang Hong's vision."}

{"id":28181,"original":"并州雁門郡人，曹魏名將，五子良將第一人。原為呂布部下，呂布兵敗時被擒，歸順曹操，因降將身分，初不受重用，但張遼為曹操南征北討，立下不世功勳，終成五子良將之首。曹操盛讚其智勇兼備、忠義兩全：「武力既弘，計略周備，質忠性一，守執節義」。張遼最為聞名一役，乃逍遙津之戰，以數百人破數萬大軍，更二度險些擒下孫權，一戰之威令吳地小兒止啼。即使後來張遼重病，孫權猶自心悸：「張遼雖病，不可當也，慎之！」張遼和關羽私交甚篤，兩人間亦有不少逸聞流傳於世。另，較早的元代雜劇、話本，甚至三國志平話中，張遼身分多為軍師、智將，更有「百計張遼」之稱。","text":"Bingzhou Yanmen County, Cao Wei famous general, the first of the five good generals. Originally a subordinate of Lu Bu, Lu Bu was captured when he was defeated and returned to Cao Cao. Because of his status as a general, he was not reused at first. However, Zhang Liao conquered Cao Cao from the north and south and made unspeakable feats and eventually became the first of the five good generals. Cao Cao praised his wisdom and courage, both loyalty and righteousness:  'Strong force, well-planned planning, quality loyalty, and integrity.' Zhang Liao’s most famous battle was the Battle of Xiaoyaojin, where hundreds of people broke through tens of thousands of troops and almost captured Sun Quan for the second time. The prestige of the first battle stopped Wu Di’s children from crying. Even after Zhang Liao was seriously ill, Sun Quan still palpitated himself:  'Although Zhang Liao is ill, you should not be taken care of!' Zhang Liao and Guan Yu have a close personal relationship, and there are many anecdotes between the two that have been passed down to the world. In addition, in earlier Yuan dynasty dramas, scripts, and even the Three Kingdoms Zhiping, Zhang Liao was mostly a military teacher and wise general, and he was even more known as the 'Hundred Tactics Zhang Liao'."}

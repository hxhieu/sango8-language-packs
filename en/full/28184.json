During the Northern Expedition of Zhuge Liang, the thief Zhang Mu in Hanzhong, Guanghan, and Mianzhu made trouble. Within ten days, Zhang Yi used a plan to behead Zhang Mu and put down the thief. He followed Ma Zhong to quell the Nanban rebellion many times, and was named the prefect of Yuexuan for his merits. During the period, he used both grace and power, vigorously developed Yuexuan, and built roads all the way to reach the capital. When Zhang Yi left Nanzhong, the people reluctantly gave up, and as many as 100 people paid tribute to Zhang Yi. During Jiang Wei's Northern Expedition, Zhang Yi was inconvenienced due to illness, so he still requested to join the army and died in battle with Wei general Xu Zhi."}

{"id":28188,"original":"沛國譙人，曹操堂弟。初期即追隨曹操征戰各地，一生歷經大小戰役無數。曹仁多被委以重任，據守要地，亦或是於敗勢中中流砥柱，堅待援軍。最著名是關羽北伐，其時史稱威震華夏，曹仁卻能死守樊城，堅持到徐晃前來救援。後人多認為曹仁不擅進攻，甚至戲稱鐵壁將軍，殊不知，能守一城一地而不拔，實乃重任。","text":" Peiguo Qiaoren, cousin of Cao Cao. In the early days, he followed Cao Cao to fight all over the country, and he experienced countless battles in his life. Cao Renduo was entrusted with important tasks, defending important places, or being a mainstay in defeat, and awaiting reinforcements. The most famous is Guan Yu's Northern Expedition. At that time, it was called Megatron China, but Cao Ren was able to defend Fancheng and insisted on Xu Huang's rescue. Later generations thought that Cao Ren was not good at offensive, and even jokingly called General Tiebi, but they did not realize that being able to defend one city and one place was an important task."}

Before the death of Emperor Wei Ming, he was left with a gu, and ordered Cao Shuang and Sima Yi to assist Cao Fang together. At first Cao Shuang didn't dare to dominate himself, and discussed with Sima Yi in case of trouble, but soon afterwards showed signs of ambition and dominance. First respected Sima Yi as the Taifu, took the opportunity to cut off Sima Yi's military power, and later appointed cronies to hold important positions in the central government. Finally, Sima Yi was forced into desperation, and when Cao Fang and Cao Shuang went to Gaopingling to pay homage to Emperor Wei Ming, they initiated the Gaopingling change. After that, Cao Wei went to Sima's house next to the power."}

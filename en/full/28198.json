Together with his father Cao Cao and his elder brother Cao Pi, they are called the 'Three Cao', the head of the Jian'an Yewen Group. Cao Cao built the Bronze Bird Terrace, and Cao Zhi's 'Bronze Bird Terrace Fu', with a good body and gorgeous writing, was 19 years old. Cao Zhi did not hold an important official position throughout his life, but Cao Cao believed that he was talented and could achieve great things, so he wanted to support him. Cao Zhi had a close relationship with Yang Xiu. From the handed down poems, Cao Zhi might have great ambitions and competed with Cao Pi for a position. However, Cao Cao knew that the two sons were fighting for prostitutes, and Yang Xiu's behavior was indiscriminate, so he killed Yang Xiu on excuses. Cao Zhi became discouraged, indulged in the wine country, and no longer wanted to fight for power. After Cao Cao's death, Cao Pi tried to kill Cao Zhi repeatedly, but was blocked by his mother. After the Ming Emperor Cao Rui came to the throne, he intended to call Cao into the imperial court, but the officials believed that Cao Zhi was unwilling to be in the lower position for a long time, so he was still not subject to heavy responsibility and died in depression. He was only 41 years old. In addition, Cao Zhi saw through Sima Yi's misconduct and repeatedly warned him on the table, but he was not believed by Emperor Wei Ming."}

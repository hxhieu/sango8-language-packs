Since he was a child, he has determined to become a military commander and has repeatedly followed Cao Cao's conquest. When Karasuma rebelled, Cao Zhang went to conquer in the name of General Xiaoqi, and then surrendered to Xianbei Ke Bineng in Liaodong. Cao Cao was overjoyed and said, \"The yellow beard is amazing!\" Cao Pi came to the throne. Cao Zhang believed that he had made merits and should be reused. But Cao Pi only followed the usual practice and did not reuse it. Cao Zhang was dissatisfied with this. After returning to the fief and garrisoned, he imprisoned harshly, making Beizhou princes fearful. He was eventually named the king of the city, and soon died of a sudden illness. \"Shi Shuo Xin Yu\" stated that Cao Zhang was poisoned by Cao Pi, but it is a novelist's statement that cannot be fully believed."}

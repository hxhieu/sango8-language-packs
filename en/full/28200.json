{"id":28200,"original":"沛國譙縣人，魏國奠基者。千古風雲人物，功過一言難盡，說是漢賊，實為英雄。許劭評為「治世之能臣，亂世之奸雄」，初有輔佐漢室之志，後見諸侯亂世，逞其能而為時雄。因討伐黃巾軍而揚名，後迎獻帝至許昌，奉天子以令不臣，敗呂布、袁術，在與袁紹決戰的官渡一役大獲全勝，掌握中原北方。但在赤壁之戰敗於孫劉聯軍，錯失一統天下的良機。雖如此，三分天下仍有其二。拜小說家之賜，被醜化為漢奸。曹操與當時引外夷為援，埋下後世五胡亂華禍種的諸侯大異，征伐驅逐，令蠻族不敢犯境；又迎回蔡琰，讓其補全戰亂佚失的諸多典籍，對保全中原文化有大功。此外，曹操長於軍事，熟讀孫子，更為其作注；亦為一代文豪，體裁多為從軍慷慨之作。","text":" Peiguo Qiaoxian, founder of Wei State. A man of the ages, it is hard to say a word of merits and demerits, saying that he is a Han thief, but he is really a hero. Xu Shao was appraised as a \"powerful minister in the world and a traitor in the troubled times.\" He had the ambition to assist the Han Dynasty at the beginning, and later saw the princes in troubled times. He became famous because of the crusade against the Yellow Turban Army. Later, he welcomed the Emperor Xian to Xuchang, and served the emperor as an order. He defeated Lu Bu and Yuan Shu. In the battle with Yuan Shao, he won a great victory in the battle of Guandu and mastered the northern part of the Central Plains. But in the battle of Chibi, he was defeated by the Sun and Liu coalition forces and missed the opportunity to dominate the world. Even so, there are still two thirds of the world. Thanks to the novelist, he was vilified as a traitor. Cao Cao was very different from the lords who had attracted the help of foreigners and buried the five chaotic Chinese hordes in later generations, conquered and expelled them, so that the barbarians did not dare to commit crimes; and welcomed Cai Yan back to fill in many of the lost classics in the war. Great contribution to the preservation of the Central Plains culture. In addition, Cao Cao grew up in the military, read his grandson well, and wrote more of his notes; he was also a generation of writers, and his genre was mostly generous work by the army."}

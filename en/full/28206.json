{"id":28206,"original":"汝南平輿人，東漢末年著名人物評論家。少壯時和堂兄許靖在汝南每月舉辦「月旦評」，評鑑天下人物，凡受兩人評價者，無不聞名一時。曹操也在橋玄的引薦之下，得到「治世之能臣，亂世之奸雄」的評價。值得一提的是，許邵當時評價曹操是「鄙其人」，但曹操得之，大笑而去。之後因中原戰亂連年，許劭避禍江南，病逝於豫章郡。","text":"Runan Pingyu, a famous critic of the late Eastern Han Dynasty. When he was young, he and his cousin Xu Jing held monthly 'monthly reviews' in Runan to evaluate people from all over the world. Those who were evaluated by two people were all famous for a while. Cao Cao was also recommended by Qiao Xuan, and was evaluated as 'a minister who governs the world and a hero in troubled times.' It is worth mentioning that Xu Shao commented that Cao Cao was 'despite him' at the time, but Cao Cao got it and laughed away. Later, due to the war in the Central Plains for years, Xu Shao avoided disaster in Jiangnan and died in Yuzhang County."}

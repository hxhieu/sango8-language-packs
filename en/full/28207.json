On the eve of the Battle of Guandu, Yuan Shao was reprimanded and left out in the cold because he had been accused of corruption and bribery. Xu You, who was old acquaintance with Cao Cao, turned to Cao and offered Wuchao's plan to burn grain. Yuan Jun was defeated. After Yuan Shao's death, Cao Cao attacked Jizhou. Due to the height of the city, the battle was stalemate. Xu You proposed the strategy of flooding the city by flooding the Zhang River, allowing Cao Jun to win the city smoothly. However, Xu You was proud of his merits and repeatedly despised Cao Cao. Later, when he entered the city gate of Yecheng, he joked, 'You don't want me, I can safely enter this gate?', he was accused by the left and right, and Cao Cao was angry that he was rude and killed."}

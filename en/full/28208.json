When he was young, he and Xu Shao were both famous for Runan Yuedan critics, but they were not in harmony. Later, due to Dong Zhuo's rebellion, he went to several princes and warlords, and was finally reused by Liu Zhang. When Liu Bei attacked Yizhou, Xu Jing abandoned the city and fled, but was captured by Liu Beijun. Liu Bei despises his unrighteous and cowardly, but Fazheng uses Xu Jing's reputation as an excuse to persuade Liu Bei to appoint Xu Jing as a high-ranking official with no real power, so as to gather people's hearts and make the talented depend on them."}

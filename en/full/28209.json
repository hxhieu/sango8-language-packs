{"id":28209,"original":"沛國譙人，曹操手下猛將，勇武寡言，有「虎痴」之名。許褚來投，曹操稱讚許褚：「此吾樊噲也。」可見曹操得許褚之喜。典韋身亡後，由許褚擔任曹操近衛，曾多次阻止刺客暗殺曹操。再伐張繡時，曹操以許褚為先鋒，大破張繡軍，斬首萬餘。於潼關之戰掩護曹操逃離馬超追擊，後曹操與馬超、韓遂會談，馬超本欲趁機擒下曹操，但許褚瞠目瞪視，使馬超忌憚而不敢妄動。許諸忠於曹操，君臣間感情深厚，曹操病逝，號泣嘔血。曹丕亦甚親近許諸，讓他掌管中軍禁軍，護衛左右。","text":"Peiguo Qiaoren, Cao Cao's fierce general, brave and reluctant to speak, has the name of 'tiger idiot'. Xu Chu came to vote, and Cao Cao praised Xu Chu:  'This is my fan.' It can be seen that Cao Cao is happy with Xu Chu. After Dianwei's death, Xu Chu served as the guard of Cao Cao and repeatedly prevented the assassins from assassinating Cao Cao. When he cut Zhang Xiu again, Cao Cao took Xu Chu as his pioneer and broke Zhang Xiujun's army and beheaded more than 10,000. The battle at Tongguan protected Cao Cao from chasing after Ma Chao. Later, Cao Cao had talks with Ma Chao and Han Sui. Ma Chao wanted to take the opportunity to capture Cao Cao, but Xu Chu Yan stared, making Ma Chao jealous and dare not move. Xu Zhu was loyal to Cao Cao, and the relationship between the monarch and his subjects was deep. Cao Cao died of illness and vomited blood. Cao Pi was also very close to Xu Zhu, letting him take charge of the Chinese Army's imprisoned army and guard the left and right."}

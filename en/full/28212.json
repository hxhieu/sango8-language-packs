{"id":28212,"original":"南陽人，蜀國侍中。正史中關於他的記述稀缺，因諸葛亮於北伐前上書的《出師表》而聞名。其中稱讚郭攸之、費褘、董允等三人皆為忠義良賢之士，受先帝劉備敬重與提拔，期望後主劉禪能與三位討論宮內諸事，補正闕漏，必有益於朝廷政事。","text":"Nanyang, a servant in Shu. There are scarce accounts of him in official history, and he is famous for Zhuge Liang's 'Bao Shi Biao' written before the Northern Expedition. Among them, Guo Youzhi, Fei Bi, and Dong Yun are praised for being loyal, righteous, and virtuous, respected and promoted by the first emperor Liu Bei. It is hoped that the latter master Liu Chan can discuss the affairs of the palace with the three and correct the faults, which will be beneficial to the court affairs."}

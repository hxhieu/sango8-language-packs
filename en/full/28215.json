{"id":28215,"original":"潁川陽翟人，曹操麾下策士，史稱：「才策謀略，世之奇士」。受荀彧引薦投身曹操，曹操初見郭嘉，即稱：「使孤成大業者，必此人也。」郭嘉亦喜曰：「真吾主也。」龍虎風雲，惺惺相惜，莫過於此。郭嘉能識人、具遠見、達於情、長於謀，但凡用策，因人而制，由人情而謀畫。諸如：官渡之戰直陳曹操十勝要素，穩定曹軍士氣；劉備新得徐州，人心未附，建議曹操急攻可破；又，在劉備最潦倒之際，評其「備有雄才而甚得眾心，備終不為人下，其謀未可測也」；斷言孫策「策輕而無備，必死於匹夫之手」；袁紹身故後，力排眾議，緩兵待變，而袁家兄弟果因爭嫡鬩牆。郭嘉於征烏桓歸途中病故，曹操痛惜郭嘉早逝，每每念之，喟嘆泣下。","text":"A man from Yingchuan Yangdi, Cao Cao's strategist, historically said:  'Talent strategy, the wonder of the world.' Recommended by Xun Yu to join Cao Cao, Cao Cao first saw Guo Jia, and said:  'The one who makes the lonely great cause must be this person.' Guo Jia also said with joy, 'I am the real master.' There is nothing more like this. Guo Jian is able to know people, have a vision, be affectionate, and be good at planning. Whenever he uses a strategy, he is governed by the person, and the painting is planned by the favor. Such as:  the battle of Guandu directly Chen Cao Cao’s ten victories, stabilized the morale of Cao’s army; Liu Bei’s new victory in Xuzhou, the heart of the people is not attached, I suggest that Cao Cao attack can be broken; also, when Liu Bei is the most depressed, he commented on his “being talented and even better. All the hearts of the people are prepared to be unpredictable, and their plans are unpredictable'; asserting that Sun Ce 'policy is light and unprepared, and will die by the hands of the husband.' After Yuan Shao passed away, he opposed all opinions and waited for change. The Yuan brothers quarreled over the wall due to the cause. Guo Jia died of illness on the way home from Zheng Wuhuan. Cao Cao lamented Guo Jia's early death. He sighed and wept every time he read it."}

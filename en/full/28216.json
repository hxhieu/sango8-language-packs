Guo Tu was originally a subordinate of Han Fu, who persuaded Han Fu to let Yuan Shao pasture Jizhou prefecture, and Yuan Shao was invited to be his subordinate for the credit. After taking refuge in Yuan Shao, he prevented Yuan Shao from welcoming the emperor, and Yuan Shao missed his reputation for time and justice. During the Battle of Guandu, Cao Cao attacked Wuchao Granary, and Guo Tuli attacked Cao Ying. Zhang Yun believed that Cao Ying was tough and should rescue the Granary. The post-war situation was as expected by Zhang Yun. Guo Tu was ashamed and feared Yuan Shao's inquiries, falsely accusing Zhang Yun of not doing his best, leading Zhang Yun to vote for Cao in anger. After Yuan Shao's death, Guo Tu and Xin Ping provoked Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang to attack each other, and even joined Cao Cao to attack Yuan Shang. In the end, Cao Cao attacked Nanpi, Yuan Tan was defeated, and Guo Tu was beheaded."}

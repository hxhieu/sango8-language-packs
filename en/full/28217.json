{"id":28217,"original":"蜀漢將軍。曾參與漢中之戰，於馬鳴道為徐晃所破。後又參與夷陵之戰，與吳班率水軍屯夷陵，因在江上又撤退即時，受損不大。諸葛亮第三次北伐時，攻克武都、陰平二郡，此後相關記載不明。民間謠傳為《三國志》作者陳壽之父，實乃牽強附會之說。陳壽父為馬謖部屬，因而受牽連獲罪，此後不得重用；而陳式卻是三次北伐時的一方統帥。","text":" General Shuhan. Once participated in the battle of Hanzhong, Yu Ma Mingdao was broken by Xu Huang. Later, he participated in the battle of Yiling, and Wu Ban led a navy army to station in Yiling. Because he retreated on the river immediately, he suffered little damage. During Zhuge Liang's third Northern Expedition, he conquered Wudu and Yinping counties. Since then, relevant records are unknown. The folk rumors as the father of Chen Shou, the author of \"Three Kingdoms\", are far-fetched. Chen Shoufu was a subordinate of Ma Di, so he was implicated and convicted and could not be reused afterwards; while Chen Shi was the commander-in-chief of the three Northern Expeditions."}

At first, he worked for Cao Cao, and later rebelled to Lu Bu. When Cao Cao sent troops to attack Tao Qian, he and Zhang Miao conspired to welcome Lu Bu as a herd in Yanzhou. The county responded, and Cao Cao lost his base. After that, he followed Lü Bu all the way and made suggestions for Lü Bu until he was defeated and captured. Cao Cao loves talents and moves with affection to persuade Chen Gong to surrender. Chen Gongjian refuses to follow him. He goes to the execution ground. Cao Cao tears off as he bids farewell to Chen Gong's family and relatives. The romance and the well-known play \"Catch and Release Cao\" invented Chen Gong as the magistrate of Zhongmou County, captured Cao Cao who was wanted for assassinating Dong Zhuo, and interpreted Cao Cao righteously."}

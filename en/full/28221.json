He was Yuan Shaojun’s assistant at first. Because of his excellent literary skills, he was responsible for drafting various official documents for Yuan Shao. The most famous is 'Yuan Shaoyu Yuzhou Wen', which counts Cao Cao’s crimes and even goes back to his father’s ancestors. After Yuan Shao's death, Chen Lin was captured by Cao Cao, and Cao Cao cherished her talents and brought her under his command. Chen Lin's literary talent is so wonderful that it can even make Cao Cao, who suffers from severe headwind, become obsessed with her essays without feeling a headache."}

{"id":28223,"original":"潁川許昌人，曹魏大臣。劉備為豫州刺史時，闢陳群為別駕。後陶謙病故，劉備欲接任徐州牧，陳群預警劉備袁術必來爭奪徐州，若呂布又趁隙襲擊，此事必定不成。之後局勢果如陳群所料。曹操滅呂布後，改出仕曹操，陳群有識人之能，向曹操推薦陳矯、戴干，不是名臣便是忠義之輩。魏國建立後，曹丕對他極為器重，屢次加官晉爵，任御史中丞期間創制「九品官人法」。陳群亦曾提出攻蜀良計，但因天候影響進軍，未能予以實踐。","text":" Xuchang from Yingchuan, Minister of Wei and Cao. When Liu Bei was the governor of Yuzhou, he set up Chen Qun as a separate driver. After Tao Qian died, Liu Bei wanted to take over as Xuzhou Mu, Chen Qun warned that Liu Bei and Yuan Shu would come to fight for Xuzhou. If Lu Bu took advantage of the gap and attacked, the matter would definitely not happen. After that, the situation was as Chen Qun expected. After Cao Cao destroyed Lu Bu, he changed to serve as Cao Cao. Chen Qun was capable of knowing people, and recommended Chen Jiao and Dai Qian to Cao Cao. They were either famous officials or loyal. After the establishment of the Wei State, Cao Pi treated him very highly, and he was repeatedly promoted to the nobility. During his tenure as Zhongcheng, he created the \"Nine Grade Officials Law.\" Chen Qun also proposed a good strategy for attacking Shu, but due to the influence of weather, he failed to put it into practice."}

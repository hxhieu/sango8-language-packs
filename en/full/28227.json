{"id":28227,"original":"吳郡吳縣人，孫吳名將，與周瑜、魯肅和呂蒙合稱四大都督。。呂蒙欲趁關羽北伐之際取荊州，其時陸遜求見呂蒙，所言與呂蒙不謀而合，呂蒙表面拒絕，後稱病回建業，旋即上表孫權，讓孫權重用陸遜。陸遜代呂蒙都督之職，修書關羽，信中言詞謙卑，令關羽輕視，成功襲取荊州。夷陵之戰，陸遜先誘劉備軍入三峽，堅守待變，趁蜀軍疲憊，又因暑熱，移入林中紮營後，火燒連營，取得大勝。石亭之戰，又大敗曹休，讓曹魏軍力大損。晚年捲入孫和與孫霸的爭嫡，孫權數度為此責罰陸遜，致陸遜鬱憤而卒。若無陸遜於夷陵、石亭兩役挫敗蜀魏，東吳後勢，恐早有反覆。","text":" Wu County, Wu County, Sun Wu, a famous general, and Zhou Yu, Lu Su and Lu Meng are collectively known as the four governors. . Lu Meng wanted to take advantage of Guan Yu's Northern Expedition to take advantage of Jingzhou. At that time, Lu Xun asked to see Lu Meng, who coincided with Lu Meng's words. Lu Meng refused on the surface, and later claimed that he was sick and returned to Jianye. Lu Xun took the post of the governor of Lv Meng, revised the book of Guan Yu, and the humble words in the letter made Guan Yu despise and succeeded in capturing Jingzhou. During the Battle of Yiling, Lu Xun first lured Liu Beijun into the Three Gorges and held on to the changes. After the Shu army was exhausted and due to the heat, he moved into the forest and camped. He burned the camp and won a big victory. In the battle of Shiting, Cao Xiu was defeated and Cao Wei's army was greatly damaged. In his later years, he was involved in the dispute between Sun He and Sun Ba. Sun Quan punished Lu Xun several times for this, causing Lu Xun to die in anger. If it were not for Lu Xun to defeat the Shu and Wei in the battles of Yiling and Shiting, and the future of Soochow, there would have been upheaval."}

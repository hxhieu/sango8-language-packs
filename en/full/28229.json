{"id":28229,"original":"丹陽郡人，東漢末年割據的軍閥。因徐州黃巾軍為禍，被封為徐州刺史，受命平亂。蓋時天下大亂，徐州相對平穩，流民多遷徙至此。但陶謙晚年昏聵，用人失當，度勢不明，徐州每況愈下，許邵評其：「陶恭祖外慕聲名，內非真正，待吾雖厚，其勢必薄。」而真正導致徐州衰敗，卻是陶謙劫殺曹操之父曹嵩，史載陶謙：「初，太祖父嵩，雲官後還譙，董卓之亂，避難琅邪，為陶謙所害。」致使曹操怒而攻徐，於彭城大戰，死者以萬數，泗水為之不流。陶謙病故前，囑託別駕麋竺讓劉備繼領徐州牧。此舉並非如演義中所述之美談，實乃陶謙不得以之舉，而劉備所得，亦是殘破衰敗一州，而非爭雄天下之本。","text":"Danyang County, a warlord who ruled in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. Because of the disaster of the Xuzhou Yellow Turban Army, he was named the governor of Xuzhou and was ordered to quell the chaos. When the world was in chaos, Xuzhou was relatively stable, and most of the refugees migrated here. However, Tao Qian was faint in his later years, improperly employed, and the situation was unclear. Xuzhou was deteriorating. Xu Shao commented on him:  'Tao Gongzu admires his fame outside and is not true inside. Although he treats me thickly, he is bound to be thin.' It was Tao that really caused the decline of Xuzhou. Qian Jie killed Cao Cao’s father, Cao Song, and Tao Qian said in history:  'In the early days, the grandfather Song, Yunguan also slandered, Dong Zhuo’s rebellion, took refuge in Langxie, and was killed by Tao Qian.' Cao Cao furiously attacked Xu, Yu In the Pengcheng battle, the number of dead was tens of thousands, but Surabaya did not. Before Tao Qian passed away, he asked Liu Bei not to drive Mizhu to lead Xuzhou herd. This is not the kind of beautiful talk described in The Romance, it is actually something that Tao Qian could not do, and Liu Bei's income is also a dilapidated and decayed state, not the foundation of the world."}

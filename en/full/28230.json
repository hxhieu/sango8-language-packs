{"id":28230,"original":"幽州廣陽人，曾先後效力蜀吳兩國。本來姓名應為士仁，傅士仁恐為傳抄時謬誤。與關羽不和，在關羽進攻襄樊時與麋芳一同倒戈，以至於荊州失守，關羽敗走麥城。但亦有一說他一度堅城自守，呂蒙派虞翻前往招降，才開城降吳。演義中，夷陵之戰前期，他與麋芳見蜀漢軍勢浩大，遂又叛吳，並意圖歸蜀，被劉備所殺。","text":"A native of Guangyang, Youzhou, who has played for both Shu and Wu. The original name should be Shiren, but Fu Shiren might be mistaken when copying. He was at odds with Guan Yu, and when Guan Yu attacked Xiangfan, he fought with Mifang, so that Jingzhou fell and Guan Yu lost Maicheng. But there is also a saying that he once defended the city and defended himself. In the Romance, in the early stage of the Yiling War, he and Mifang saw that the Shu Han army was powerful, and then rebelled against Wu and intended to return to Shu, and was killed by Liu Bei."}

{"id":28238,"original":"兗州東郡人，曹魏重臣。曹操入兗州，聘請程昱出仕，程昱欣然而往。曹操征徐州時，陳宮、張邈叛變，迎呂布入兗州，郡縣響應，荀彧、程昱、夏侯惇等人堅守鄄城、范縣、東阿縣，多賴程昱奔走，安定民心，才守住三城。當時又因蝗災，暴發饑荒，程昱為曹操徵募糧草，可說曹操收復兗州，程昱該當首功。程昱雖不若荀攸、郭嘉等人耀眼，卻也是謀臣中的骨幹，但因在濮陽徵募糧草時疑似夾有人脯，為人詬病，雖然功高，但終生未列三公。","text":" Yanzhou Dongjun, Cao Wei Zhongchen. Cao Cao entered Yanzhou and hired Cheng Yu as an official, but Cheng Yuxin went. When Cao Cao conquered Xuzhou, Chen Gong and Zhang Miao rebelled and welcomed Lv Bu into Yanzhou. The counties responded. Xun Yu, Cheng Yu, Xiahou Dun and others insisted on holding Juancheng, Fanxian, and Dong'e counties. Cheng Yu ran away and settled the hearts of the people. Three cities. At that time, due to the locust plague and famine, Cheng Yu recruited food and grass for Cao Cao. It can be said that Cao Cao regained Yanzhou and Cheng Yu should take the lead. Although Cheng Yu is not as dazzling as Xun You, Guo Jia and others, he is also the backbone of the advisers. However, he was criticized because he was suspected of picking up some preserved food when recruiting grain and grass in Puyang. Although he was a good performer, he was not listed as a third man in his life."}

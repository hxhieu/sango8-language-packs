Later Cao Cao sent Zhong Yao to guard the Guanzhong until Ma Chaohan rebelled and united the eight generals of Guanzhong including Cheng Yin, so the Romance called Cheng Yin one of the eight generals of Ma Chao. There is no follow-up record in the official history, and Yanyi only said that after Ma Chao Weinan's defeat, he counted soldiers and found that Cheng Yin was no longer there."}

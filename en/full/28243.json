As Dong Zhuo's general, he was beheaded by Sun Jian. The original surname should be Ye, and Hua Xiong suspected that due to clerical errors and opera processing, it was misrepresented. In the novel, he recommended himself to fight against the anti-Dong princes. Before Bian Shuiguan, he successively killed Bao Xin’s younger brother Bao Zhong, Sun Jian’s general Zu Mao, Yuan Shubu general Yu She, and Han Fu general General Pan Feng. Finally, Guan Yu asked for a battle, and Cao Cao served Guan Yu’s own love. With the courage of the wine, Guan Yu came out and returned home after cutting Huaxiong, while the wine was still warm."}

{"id":28244,"original":"平原高唐人，年少就已聞名。能識人，看出王芬沒有足夠能力廢靈帝，必定失敗且禍連宗族。華歆曾建議袁術追擊董卓，但不被贊同，於是離去。任豫章太守時極受愛戴，孫策非常賞識華歆，待以上賓。後曹操徵招，孫權本不欲准行，但華歆以聯好曹操為由，說服孫權。華歆雖為名士，清純德素，但爭議亦多，有部分史載華歆奉命誅殺伏皇后、並為曹丕篡漢謀畫。","text":"The Gaotang people in the plains have been famous since they were young. Knowing people and seeing that Wang Fen is not capable enough to destroy the Spirit Emperor, he will definitely fail and bring disaster to the clan. Hua Xin once suggested Yuan Shu to pursue Dong Zhuo, but was disapproved and left. Ren Yuzhang was very much loved when he was prefect, and Sun Ce appreciated Huaxin very much and waited for him. After Cao Cao recruited, Sun Quan didn't want to be allowed to do so, but Hua Xin persuaded Sun Quan on the grounds of joining Cao Cao. Although Hua Xin is a celebrity, pure and pure, but there are many controversies. There are some historical records that Hua Xin was ordered to kill the empress and plot paintings for Cao Pi to usurp the Han."}

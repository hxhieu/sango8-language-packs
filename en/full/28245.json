The Romance includes dramas, dramas and anecdotes from various families to become the four beauties of China-Diao Chan. Originally a singer of Wang Yun, who was good at singing and dancing, she was accepted as a righteous daughter by Wang Yun, who assisted Wang Yun to destroy Dong Zhuo, separated Dong Zhuo and Lu Bu with beauty, and Lu Bu eventually assassinated Dong Zhuo and married Diao Chan as a side room. When Cao Cao attacked Lu Bu, Chen Gong once advised that Lu Bu should station troops outside of Xiapi City and acted as horns for each other. However, Diao Chan and Yan Shi in the main room prevented Lu Bu from leaving the city on the grounds that 'the general is outside, there may be changes in the city.' Lu Bu was passive and trapped in Xiapi. After Lu Bu's death, Diao Chan was escorted to Xudu, but the fate is unknown. There are also many operas and novels that record anecdotes between Diao Chan and Guan Yu."}

{"id":28246,"original":"益州犍為人，原為劉璋部下，。在劉備攻打綿竹時跟李嚴一起投降，受到劉備重用。曾說服關羽接受與黃忠共為四方將軍，但在劉備稱帝時持反對意見被降職，直到諸葛亮南征孟獲時方復用。費詩見事明斷，口才好，率意而言，諸葛亮過世後亦得蔣琬重用，子嗣在蜀國滅亡後仍為西晉官員。","text":"Yizhou Qian is a man, originally a subordinate of Liu Zhang. When Liu Bei attacked Mianzhu, he surrendered with Li Yan and was reused by Liu Bei. Once persuaded Guan Yu to accept and Huang Zhong as the generals of the Quartet, but when Liu Bei proclaimed his emperor, he objected and was demoted until Zhuge Liang conquered Meng in the south. Fei Shi was clear and eloquent. To put it bluntly, Zhuge Liang had to be reused by Jiang Wan after his death, and his heirs remained officials of the Western Jin Dynasty after the fall of Shu."}

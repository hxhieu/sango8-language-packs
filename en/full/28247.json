{"id":28247,"original":"荊州江夏人，蜀漢重臣，與諸葛亮、蔣琬、董允並稱為蜀漢四相。劉備入蜀後出仕劉備，受諸葛亮重用，曾出使東吳，據理巧辯，折服孫權及江東眾臣。在諸葛亮與蔣琬死去後，繼任為相，對國事軍事力求穩重，休養生息，和主張北伐的姜維意見相左，後世史家以為蜀漢因此錯失北伐良機。費禕個性和善大度，對降將也非常親近，幾無防備，張嶷曾勸告費禕多加小心，以防遇刺，費禕沒有聽從，日後果然在宴席上被魏國降將郭脩刺殺，不治身亡。","text":"Jiangxia, Jingzhou, a heavy minister of the Shu Han, and Zhuge Liang, Jiang Wan, and Dong Yun are called the four phases of the Shu Han. After Liu Bei entered Shu, he became an official Liu Bei, and was reused by Zhuge Liang. He was once an envoy to Soochow. He convincingly convinced Sun Quan and Jiangdong officials. After Zhuge Liang and Jiang Wan died, they succeeded in taking the post, striving to be stable on state affairs and military affairs, recuperating and rejuvenating, and disagreeing with Jiang Wei who advocated the Northern Expedition. Later historians believed that the Shu Han missed the opportunity of the Northern Expedition. Fei Yi had a kind and generous personality and was very close to the surrender. He was almost unprepared. Zhang Yi once advised Fei Yi to be more careful in case of assassination. Fei Yi didn't obey, and he was assassinated by Wei Guojiang general Guo Xiu at the banquet and died."}

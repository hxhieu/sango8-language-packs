{"id":28250,"original":"荊州南陽郡人，演義中為蜀國五虎將之一。原劉表部將，劉表陣亡後歸於長沙太守韓玄麾下。黃忠隨韓玄一同歸順劉備，益州之戰時，與魏延兩人作為先鋒十分活躍。漢中之戰與法正聯手，在定軍山大敗曹軍，陣斬夏侯淵。同年因功升為征西將軍，劉備封漢中王，又改封為後將軍，翌年病卒。三國志中僅三百字記錄，亦無註解，其中頗有矛盾。黃忠可能是統轄長沙太守，而非隸屬其下；又生年不詳，老兵一詞乃出自費詩傳中，關羽憤懟之言，不可全信。演義中杜撰與關羽相鬥，實力不相上下。史實其時關羽等諸將在攻略南郡，四郡乃劉備率軍親征。","text":" A native of Nanyang County, Jingzhou, one of the Five Tigers of Shu Kingdom in the Romance.

The following year, he died of illness. In the Three Kingdoms, only 300 words are recorded and there are no annotations, which are quite contradictory. Huang Zhong may be the prefect of Changsha, rather than subordinate to him; and his birth year is unknown, the term veteran comes from Fei's poetry biography, Guan Yu's angry words cannot be fully believed. In the novel, he fought with Guan Yu, and his strength was equal. Historical facts At that time, Guan Yu and other generals were attacking South County, and Liu Bei led his army to conquer the four counties."}

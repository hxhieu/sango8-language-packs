When fighting against Sun Jian, he was defeated and fled into the mountains. Sun Jian was careless and died. Therefore, he and the Sun family forged a feud. Later, Sun Ce and Sun Quan fought against Huang Zu several times, winning each other's victory and defeating each other. The former served as the commander of Huang Zu's Gan Ning, and even shot the Sun family general Ling Cao and repelled Sun Jun. But because Huang Zu never reused Gan Ning, Gan Ning defected to his grandson. Huang Zu was finally broken by Sun Quan in the 13th year of Jian'an, and was killed by Sun Wu Xiaobing while fleeing. In addition, Huang Zu was impatient and irritable, and killed Mi Heng, who was rude in his words and deeds, which made the scholars at that time criticize him."}

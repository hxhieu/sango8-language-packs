When Li Wei and Guo Bin attacked each other in Chang'an, they were lured by Zhong Yao to rebel against Li Wei, and the Emperor Xian was able to take advantage of the gap and return to Luoyang. After that, Ma Chao went to Longyou, and Zhang Lu also sent general Yang Ang to help Ma Chao attack Jicheng. When Cao Cao asked Zhang Lu, Yang Ang was ordered to guard Yangping Pass. After Zhang Lu surrendered, there is no more relevant account. In \"The Romance of the Three Kingdoms,\" Zhang Xi died at Yangping Pass."}

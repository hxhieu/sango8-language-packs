{"id":28261,"original":"荊州襄陽人，蜀漢文官，深得諸葛亮信任。初仕曹魏，後投奔關羽，雖得劉備賞識，但與劉巴不合，被貶為有名無實的弘農太守。跟隨諸葛亮北伐深受重用，又與魏延齟齬。諸葛亮病逝五丈原，楊、魏兩人互指謀反，相峙不下。王平以諸葛亮為由，說動魏延部眾，魏延兵隊潰散，楊儀派馬岱追殺，夷三族。楊儀肚量狹窄，漸不受重用，竟口出叛逆狂言：「吾若舉軍以就魏氏，處世寧當落度如此邪！令人追悔不可複及。」劉禪念楊儀有功，廢為平民，未加重責，可楊儀依舊故我，被補下獄，自殺身亡。","text":"A native of Xiangyang, Jingzhou, a civil official of the Han Dynasty, won the trust of Zhuge Liang. He first served as Cao Wei and later went to Guan Yu. Although he was appreciated by Liu Bei, he did not agree with Liu Ba and was relegated to the notorious prefect of Hongnong. Following Zhuge Liang's Northern Expedition, he was heavily used, and at odds with Wei Yan. Zhuge Liang died of illness in Wuzhangyuan, Yang and Wei both accused each other of rebellion, and they could not stand each other. Wang Ping used Zhuge Liang as an excuse to persuade Wei Yan's tribe, and Wei Yan's army collapsed. Yang Yi sent Ma Dai to chase and kill the Yi tribe. Yang Yi's belly is narrow, and she is gradually not being reused. She actually uttered rebellious words:  'If I raise the army, I will be the Wei family, and I would rather fall into this evil life! It is regrettable.' Without aggravating the blame, Yang Yi still died, was made up for jail, and committed suicide."}

Formerly a subordinate of Wang Lang, Wang Lang was defeated by Sun Ce and was used by Sun Cedeng after he helped Wang Lang escape and return to his hometown. Sun Ce was assassinated and died. The situation in Jiangdong was ambiguous, and the people were afraid of changes. He stayed in Shouchun and did not go to the funeral. This move really turned Jiangdong into peace. Although Yu Fan is talented, he has a perverse personality and a keen talk. He repeatedly committed crimes or slandered the officials, thus offending Sun Quan and was exiled to Jiaozhou. Exiled to the border, Yu Fan still cares about the affairs of the Soochow. Sun Quan wanted to ask Gongsun Yuan for a horse, but Yu had no way to persuade him. In the future, Sun Quan failed to seek a horse. He regretted his exile and sent someone to invite Yufan. However, Yufan has passed away and he is seventy years old."}

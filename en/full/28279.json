{"id":28279,"original":"山陽昌邑人，曹魏名將。初由劉曄舉諫而被錄用，以廉潔著稱，任許令時，無懼曹操權勢，依法處決曹洪門下食客，此舉和早年曹操任洛陽北部尉時如出一轍，令曹操贊賞不已。曹袁相爭，滿寵時為汝南太守，先後攻克二十餘處不服的地方勢力，又設宴誘其餘未降渠帥，殺十餘人，令汝南太平。關羽攻樊城，眾將皆勸曹仁退兵，滿寵分析天時利害，讓曹仁堅守，不久後徐晃率軍救援，內外夾攻，擊退關羽。滿寵常年駐守東南，深明形勢，主張於合肥建新城，以犄角之勢抵抗東吳入侵，孫權數次親征，都因滿寵之故，無功而返。滿寵效力曹氏四代，忠心功高，可惜晚年因王凌的讒言而失勢，若仍在朝，當可節制權臣專擅。","text":" Shanyang Changyi people, Cao Wei famous general.

When Xu Ling was appointed, he did not fear Cao Cao's power and executed Cao Hongmen diners in accordance with the law.

He successively conquered more than 20 local forces that were dissatisfied with. He also set up a banquet to lure the rest of the commanders and killed more than ten people to make Runan peaceful. Guan Yu attacked Fancheng, and the generals persuaded Cao Ren to retreat. Man Chong analyzed the advantages of the time and made Cao Ren hold on. Soon after, Xu Huang led his army to rescue, attacking inside and outside, and repelling Guan Yu. Manchong stationed in the southeast all the year round and understood the situation well.

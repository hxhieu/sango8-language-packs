{"id":28283,"original":"常山真定人，趙雲長子。官至虎賁中郎將，統掌禁軍，劉禪對其信任恩寵不下當年趙雲。延熙年間又督行領軍，職權略低於當時的衛將軍諸葛瞻。諸葛瞻亦曾任羽林中郎將，由此可知趙雲在劉禪心中的地位，不亞於諸葛亮。此後趙統記載不明，或於景耀年間過世。","text":"Changshan is a real man, the eldest son of Zhao Yun. From the official to the tiger, Benzhong, and the general ruler, Liu Chan trusts and favors Zhao Yun no less than in the past. During the Yanxi period, he supervised and led the army, and his authority was slightly lower than that of the then general Wei Zhugezhan. Zhuge Zhan also served as Yulin Zhonglang general, which shows that Zhao Yun's position in Liu Chan's heart is no less than Zhuge Liang. After that, Zhao Tong's record is unknown, or he died in the Jingyao period."}

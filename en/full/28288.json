When Liu Biaoxin arrived in Jingzhou, he suffered from the dissatisfaction of the local clans in Jingzhou and the dissatisfaction of the people. He wanted to recruit troops to quell the chaos, so he sought advice from Kuailiang and his brother Kuaiyue. Kuailiang proposed to let benevolence and righteousness go hand in hand, and the people would surrender, so there is no need to worry about conscription. After Liu Biao heard this, he rejoiced and praised Kuailiang as \"the theory of Yongji.\" In the novel, Liu Biao proposed a strategy for Huang Zu to fraudulently defeat, and set up an ambush to ambush Sun Jian, which caused Sun Jian to die in battle and relieved Liu Biao's crisis."}

{"id":28293,"original":"山陽郡高平縣人，儒士而掌軍權，東漢末年佔有荊州，亦為當代名士「八俊」之一。赴任荊州時，途遇宗賊和袁術阻道，遂捨下隨扈，單騎而往，得蒯良、蒯越、蔡瑁等人之助，掌握荊州。討董聯盟瓦解後，袁紹欲以劉表牽制袁術，袁術亦打算取荊州，故與孫堅一起合擊劉表。孫堅大敗劉表，圍劉表於襄陽，但孫堅因中流矢而亡，劉表反敗為勝。晚年不復少壯時的膽氣，遇事常舉棋不定，又偏安一隅，不涉中原紛爭，更因遲遲未立嫡子，導致二子相爭。病死後由劉琮繼任，劉琮依群臣之意降曹。","text":"A native of Gaoping County, Sanyang County, Confucian scholars held military power. He occupied Jingzhou at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty. He is also one of the \"Eight Masters\" of contemporary celebrities. When he arrived in Jingzhou, he met Zong thief and Yuan Shu to block the way, so he left and followed Hu and rode alone. With the help of Kuailiang, Kuaiyue, Cai Hong and others, he mastered Jingzhou. After the collapse of the Dong Dong alliance, Yuan Shao wanted to use Liu Biao to contain Yuan Shu, and Yuan Shu also planned to take Jingzhou, so he and Sun Jian attacked Liu Biao together. Sun Jian defeated Liu Biao and surrounded Liu Biao in Xiangyang, but Sun Jian died because of a mid-stream attack, and Liu Biao turned defeat into victory. In his later years, the courage of his youth was no longer there, and he was often hesitating when encountering things, and he was in peace, not involved in the disputes of the Central Plains, and because of the delay in establishing a son, the two sons quarreled. After his death, Liu Cong was succeeded by Liu Cong, who surrendered to Cao according to the wishes of the officials."}

{"id":28294,"original":"長沙郡羅縣人，原為寇氏之子。劉備喜其勇武，收為義子後改姓劉。劉封之勇，見於史料，三國志中明載：「所在戰克。」關羽伐魏，劉封、孟達以上庸三郡新降，人心未穩，拒發兵援助，關羽因而敗走麥城。事後孟達旋即叛蜀降魏，與夏侯尚、徐晃合兵攻打上庸。期間孟達修書勸降劉封，劉封嚴詞拒絕，固守奮戰。無奈軍力懸殊，加之西城太守申儀、上庸太守申耽接連反叛，劉封敗退成都。劉備罪責劉封，賜劉封自盡，劉封臨死之前悲嘆：「恨不用孟子度之言！」劉封之所以不得不死，最關鍵處，恐是諸葛亮所諫：「封剛猛，易世之後終難制御。」但臥龍所言，豈非玄德之意？","text":"Luo County, Changsha County, originally the son of Kou. Liu Bei was pleased with his bravery and changed his surname to Liu after he was accepted as a righteous son. Liu Fengzhiyong, found in historical materials, clearly stated in the history of the Three Kingdoms:  'Where is the battle.' Guan Yu defeated Wei, Liu Feng, and Mengda were newly surrendered to the three prefectures of Yong. The hearts of the people were unstable, and they refused to send troops to aid. Guan Yu was defeated by Maicheng. Afterwards, Meng Da rebelled against Shu and returned to Wei, and joined forces with Xiahoushang and Xu Huang to attack Shangyong. During the period, Meng Da revised his book and persuaded Liu Feng to surrender, but Liu Feng refused strictly and fought hard. Helplessly, the military disparity, coupled with the rebellion of the prefect of Xicheng Shenyi and the prefect of Shangyong Shen Dan, Liu Feng retreated to Chengdu. Liu Bei blamed Liu Feng and gave Liu Feng to commit suicide. Before he died, Liu Feng lamented:  'Hate not to use Mencius' words!' The most important reason why Liu Feng had to die is probably Zhuge Liang's advice:  'Feng is strong and fierce, after changing the world. It will be difficult to control.' But what Wolong said, is it not the meaning of Xuan De?"}

{"id":28294,"original":"長沙郡羅縣人，原為寇氏之子。劉備喜其勇武，收為義子後改姓劉。劉封之勇，見於史料，三國志中明載：「所在戰克。」關羽伐魏，劉封、孟達以上庸三郡新降，人心未穩，拒發兵援助，關羽因而敗走麥城。事後孟達旋即叛蜀降魏，與夏侯尚、徐晃合兵攻打上庸。期間孟達修書勸降劉封，劉封嚴詞拒絕，固守奮戰。無奈軍力懸殊，加之西城太守申儀、上庸太守申耽接連反叛，劉封敗退成都。劉備罪責劉封，賜劉封自盡，劉封臨死之前悲嘆：「恨不用孟子度之言！」劉封之所以不得不死，最關鍵處，恐是諸葛亮所諫：「封剛猛，易世之後終難制御。」但臥龍所言，豈非玄德之意？","text":"Luo County, Changsha County, originally the son of Kou.

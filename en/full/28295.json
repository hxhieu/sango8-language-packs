In the official history, he was only mentioned in a few figures, and he was originally Liu Biao's subordinate, but also a few Jingzhou officials who favored Liu Qi. In 'The Romance of the Three Kingdoms', he is a cowardly and indecisive man. Everything is controlled by his son Liu Xian. Under Liu Xian's suggestion, Lingling County sent troops to resist Liu Beijun's aggression, but general Xing Daorong and Liu Xian lost to Zhao Yun and were captured. Later, Liu Xian served as a lobbyist and convinced his father Liu Du to surrender."}

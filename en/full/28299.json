{"id":28299,"original":"兗州山陽郡高平縣人，劉表長子。劉琦與劉表五官肖似，一度深得寵愛。然因劉表後妻蔡氏為庶子劉琮謀權，鼓吹劉表廢嫡立庶，聯合蔡瑁、張允等人攻訐劉琦。劉表聽信讒言，疏遠劉琦。劉琦擔憂處境，遂以上屋抽梯之計，求策諸葛亮。諸葛亮引用晉文公典故，勸劉琦出走江夏。數月後，劉表病危，劉琦遭蔡張阻攔，至劉表逝世都未能見上父親一面。後曹操下荊州，劉琦出奔劉備。赤壁戰後，建安十四年，劉備舉薦劉琦為荊州刺史，以劉琦名義收攏荊南四郡。同年，劉琦病故，結束碌碌無為的一生。無怪乎曹操譏刺：「劉景升兒子若豚犬耳。」","text":"A native of Gaoping County, Shanyang County, Yanzhou, the eldest son of Liu Biao. Liu Qi and Liu Biao had similar facial features, and they were once favored. However, because Liu Biao’s second wife, Cai clan, sought power for his concubine Liu Cong, he advocated Liu Biao’s abolition of the concubine’s concubine and jointly attacked Liu Qi with Cai Cong and Zhang Yun. Liu Biao listened to the slander and alienated Liu Qi. Liu Qi was worried about the situation, so he tried to draw a ladder from the house and asked Zhuge Liang for advice. Zhuge Liang quoted Jin Wengong's allusions to persuade Liu Qi to leave Jiangxia. A few months later, Liu Biao was critically ill, and Liu Qi was blocked by Cai Zhang. Until Liu Biao died, he could not see his father. After Cao Cao went to Jingzhou, Liu Qi went to Liu Bei. After the Chibi War, in the 14th year of Jian'an, Liu Bei recommended Liu Qi as the governor of Jingzhou, and gathered the four counties of Jingnan in the name of Liu Qi. In the same year, Liu Qi died of illness, ending a mediocre life. No wonder Cao Cao sneered:  'Liu Jingsheng's son is like a dolphin ear.'"}

{"id":28300,"original":"兗州山陽郡高平縣人，劉表次子。雖演義指蔡氏為劉琮謀權，乃因兩人為母子，但大多史料並未明確記載，倒是後漢書中提及：「為琮娶其後妻蔡氏之侄，蔡氏遂愛琮而惡琦，毀譽之言日聞於表。」劉表身故後，劉琦繼承官爵，逢曹操率大軍南征，在蒯越、韓嵩及東曹掾傅巽等游說下，劉琮舉荊州降曹。曹操兵不血刃收降荊州，大喜之下，表劉琮為青州刺史，封列侯。演義中述劉琮於赴任青洲途中為曹所殺並非史實，三國志中，裴松之注引魏武故事，曹操親下詔令讚譽劉琮，進而「表青州刺史琮為諫議大夫 ，參同軍事。」","text":"A native of Gaoping County, Shanyang County, Yanzhou, the second son of Liu Biao. Although the Romance refers to Cai’s conspiracy for Liu Cong’s power, it is because the two were mothers and sons, but most of the historical data is not clearly recorded, but it is mentioned in the later Han books:  'For Cong to marry his next wife, Cai’s nephew, Cai loves Cong and hates Qi and ruins his reputation. After the death of Liu Biao, Liu Qi inherited the ranks of officials. When Cao Cao led the army to march south, Liu Cong surrendered Jingzhou to Cao Cao with the lobbying of Kuai Yue, Han Song, and Dong Cao Fu Xun. Cao Cao's soldiers surrendered to Jingzhou without a bloody sword. With great joy, Liu Cong was the governor of Qingzhou and named Liehou. It is not historical fact that Liu Cong was killed by Cao on his way to Qingzhou in the romance. In the Three Kingdoms, Pei Songzhi quoted the story of Wei Wu, and Cao Cao issued an edict to praise Liu Cong, and then 'showed that Shi Cong of Qingzhou was an admonishment doctor' and participated in the military.

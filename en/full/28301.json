{"id":28301,"original":"江夏竟陵人，劉焉之子。劉焉死後，劉璋繼掌益州刺史，得朝廷詔為益州牧。劉璋性格懦弱，原本依附於劉焉的漢中張魯漸生異心，不從劉璋號令，劉璋怒而殺張魯母弟，雙方反目，數度交戰。之後又逢曹操下荊州，更傳言曹操意圖攻略益州。劉璋兩面逢敵，聽信手下張松、法正之言，迎劉備入蜀，但劉備甫入蜀便招攬人心，之後更藉口劉璋未派援軍助陣為由叛變。期間劉璋軍雖一度挫敗劉備，但之後諸葛亮、張飛、趙雲由荊州來援，圍劉璋於成都，劉璋不願軍民受難，開城投降。劉璋才非人雄，而性寬厚懦弱、仁而無智，又據天府之地，其見奪取，非不幸也。","text":" Jiangxia Jingling, son of Liu Yan. After Liu Yan's death, Liu Zhang succeeded in taking charge of the governor of Yizhou. Liu Zhang has a cowardly character. Zhang Lu, who was originally attached to Liu Yan in Hanzhong, has become alienated. If he does not follow Liu Zhang's orders, Liu Zhang is angry and kills Zhang Lu's mother and brother. The two sides fought against each other and fought several times. Later, when Cao Cao went to Jingzhou, it was rumored that Cao Cao intended to attack Yizhou. Liu Zhang met his enemies on both sides, heeded the words of his subordinates Zhang Song and Fazheng, and welcomed Liu Bei into Shu, but Liu Beifu attracted people's hearts when he entered Shu, and later he rebelled on the excuse that Liu Zhang had not sent reinforcements to help. Although Liu Zhang's army defeated Liu Bei for a while, Zhuge Liang, Zhang Fei, and Zhao Yun were aided by Jingzhou and surrounded Liu Zhang in Chengdu. Liu Zhang did not want the soldiers and civilians to suffer, and Kaicheng surrendered. Liu Zhang is not a human being, but he is lenient, weak, benevolent, and ignorant. He is also based on the land of heaven."}

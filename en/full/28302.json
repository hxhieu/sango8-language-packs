{"id":28302,"original":"淮南成德人，曹魏的文官，歷事曹操、曹丕和曹叡三代。頗有智計，許劭曾評其：「有佐世之才。」曹操進攻漢中時，因久攻不下，有意退兵，劉曄見夜裡守軍陣營混亂，於是要曹操進軍，果然大勝。又料定劉備新得蜀，人心不附，速攻可下，但曹操未從，而後從蜀地難民口中證明劉曄所料，可戰機已失。曹丕繼位後，斷言劉備會為關羽報仇進攻孫吳，也識破孫權並非真心服從曹魏，勸諫應趁虛攻打吳國，曹丕不聽，待發現孫權有不臣之心後，為時已晚。劉曄晚年漸淪為只知巴結討好的庸臣，明帝曹叡在位期間曾誣陷過陳矯，又被明帝發覺揣摩聖意，遭到疏遠，因此發狂。","text":"Huainan Chengde, a civil servant of Cao Wei, and has a history of Cao Cao, Cao Pi and Cao Rui. Quite wise, Xu Shao once commented on him:  'There are talents in the world.' When Cao Cao attacked Hanzhong, he was unable to attack for a long time and deliberately retreated. Liu Ye saw that the camp of the defenders was chaotic at night, so he asked Cao Cao to march, and he won. It is also expected that Liu Beixin will win Shu, and the hearts of the people are not attached and can be attacked quickly, but Cao Cao did not follow it. Then it was proved from the refugees from Shu that Liu Ye had expected that the war opportunity had been lost. After Cao Pi succeeded to the throne, he asserted that Liu Bei would avenge Guan Yu and attack Sun Wu. He also saw that Sun Quan was not really obedient to Cao Wei. He persuaded that he should take advantage of the false attack to attack the State of Wu. Cao Pi would not listen. It was too late when he found out that Sun Quan was not a minister. . In his later years, Liu Ye gradually turned into a mediocre minister who only knew to please. During his reign, Emperor Cao Rui had framed Chen Jiao, and was found to be alienated by Ming Emperor Cao Rui."}

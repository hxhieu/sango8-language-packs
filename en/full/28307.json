{"id":28307,"original":"兗州陽平郡人，魏五子良將之一。曹操舉義兵招賢時，便已追隨於帳下，常為先登，征張繡、圍呂布、攻劉備，皆破之，屢立戰功。官渡之戰作為曹操的先鋒，奪勇力戰，俘虜袁紹將領淳于瓊。赤壁敗後，曹操留曹仁、樂進等防守荊州，關羽截斷襄陽守將曹仁後路，被樂進、文聘擊退。又與張遼、李典攜手，於合肥之戰大勝孫權。樂進以驍果顯名，卻不知為何史書記載不多，裴松之作注時也幾無史料可引。","text":"A native of Yangping County, Yanzhou, one of Wei's five best generals. When Cao Cao recruited volunteers, he had already followed the account. He was often first ascending, enlisting Zhang embroidery, besieging Lu Bu, and attacking Liu Bei. As Cao Cao's vanguard in the Battle of Guandu, he captured his courage and captured General Yuan Shao and Chunyuqiong. After the defeat of Chibi, Cao Cao left Cao Ren and Le Jin to defend Jingzhou. Guan Yu intercepted the back of Xiangyang defender Cao Ren and was repelled by Le Jin and Wenpin. Together with Zhang Liao and Li Dian, they defeated Sun Quan in the battle of Hefei. Le Jin is famous for Xiaoguo, but I don't know why there are not many historical records, and there is little historical data to quote when Pei Songzhi wrote."}

After the defeat in the Battle of Guandu, Yuan Shao took hundreds of his cronies across the river in a hurry and fled into the camp of Jiang Yiqu. Later, Jiang Yiqu went out of the camp to issue an order on behalf of Yuan Shao to gather the remnants to make Yuan Jun's situation a little more peaceful, so that he would not be chased and annihilated by the Cao Jun. After that, there was no record in history books."}

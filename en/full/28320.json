{"id":28320,"original":"徐州琅琊人，蜀漢丞相。隨叔父諸葛玄至荊州，與荊州名士司馬徽、龐德公等結交，又與徐庶、龐統相識，雅稱「臥龍」。劉備三顧茅廬後出仕，獻策《隆中對》，劉備以此而成一方霸主。《隆中對》和張紘的《江都對》、魯肅的《榻上策》皆提出了相近的戰略，先佔江南荊州立足，後圖蜀地，藉此割據一方，與中原抗衡。諸葛亮長於政事，具遠略，戰陣用兵次之，劉備過世後，隻身撐起蜀漢，事必躬親，最終積勞成疾，病逝五丈原。演義中誇大描寫，多智近妖，宛若神仙，反倒掩沒了諸葛武侯真正的絕世風采。","text":"Xuzhou Langya people, the prime minister of the Shu Han. He traveled to Jingzhou with his uncle Zhugexuan, and befriended Jingzhou celebrities Sima Hui and Pang De Gong, and also met Xu Shu and Pang Tong, elegantly known as \"Wolong.\" After Liu Bei visited the thatched cottage for three times, he offered the strategy of \"Long Zhong Dui\", which made Liu Bei the overlord. \"Longzhong Dui\", Zhang Hong's \"Jiang Du Dui\", and Lu Su's \"Tao Shang Ce\" all proposed similar strategies, first occupying a foothold in Jingzhou in the south of the Yangtze River, and then drawing on the land of Shu in the south of the Yangtze River, thereby segregating one side and competing with the Central Plains. Zhuge Liang was good at political affairs and had a long-term strategy. He used troops in battle. After Liu Bei passed away, he supported the Shu Han by himself. He must do everything by himself. Eventually, he became ill and died of illness in Wuzhangyuan. The exaggerated description in the novel is so wise and close to the demon, just like a fairy, but it conceals the true peerless style of Zhuge Wuhou."}

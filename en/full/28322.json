{"id":28322,"original":"徐州琅琊人，東吳重臣。諸葛亮之兄長，東吳武將。孫權遣其入蜀出使劉備時，與諸葛亮公會相見，退無私面，公私分明，因而受到讚許。夷陵之戰前，曾寫信勸諫劉備，希望他不要為報關羽之仇而發兵攻吳，然其中言詞頗令人玩味。諸葛謹一生雖無立下不世功勳，但因個性恢弘有雅量，又善於審時度勢，委婉應對孫權，甚得東吳君臣之心，仕途一路順遂，官至大將軍。","text":"A native of Langya in Xuzhou, a heavy minister of Dongwu. Zhuge Liang's elder brother, Dongwu general. When Sun Quan sent his envoy to Shu, Liu Bei, he met with Zhuge Liang's Guild. He was selfless and distinguished between public and private, so he was praised. Before the battle of Yiling, I wrote to advise Liu Bei, hoping that he would not send troops to attack Wu in order to declare the enmity of Guan Yu, but the words in it are quite interesting. Although Zhuge Jin did not make life-long feats in his life, but because of his magnificent and elegant personality, he was also good at judging the situation and responding to Sun Quan euphemistically, and he was inspired by the emperors and ministers of the Eastern Wu."}

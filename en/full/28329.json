{"id":28329,"original":"臨淮郡東城縣人，東吳重臣。正史上與演義的形象相去甚遠，史稱：「少有壯節，好為奇計。家富於財，性好施與。建獨斷之明，出眾人之表，實奇才也。」少時即和周瑜結為知己，受周瑜舉薦出仕孫權。孫權見魯肅甚喜，合榻對飲，魯肅更提出三國三大策之一的榻上策，陳述天下局勢，畫江分治的天下二分之計，其時世間未聞隆中對！赤壁之戰與周瑜同為主戰一方，早早預知情勢，趁曹軍未至，主動請纓出使劉備，促成孫劉同盟。周瑜病危前向孫權推舉魯肅繼任。而後劉備借占荊州不還，關羽率兵驅走東吳所任官吏，局面一觸即發。魯肅親至益陽，與關羽談判，言詞慷慨，進退有據，最終議定割湘水為界，成功索回長沙、桂陽、江夏。","text":"A native of Dongcheng County, Linhuai County, and a heavy minister of Dongwu. The official history is a far cry from the image of Romance. The history said:  'There are few strong points, so it is a magic trick. The family is rich in wealth, and the sex is good. The establishment of arbitrariness, the appearance of others, and the real genius.' That is, he became a confidant with Zhou Yu, and was recommended by Zhou Yu to become a grandson. Sun Quan was very happy when he saw Lu Su, and he was on the couch and drink. Lu Su also proposed one of the three three countries’ three strategies on the couch, stating the situation of the world and drawing the division of the river into the world. At that time, the world had never heard of it! The Battle of Chibi and Zhou Yu were the main side of the battle. They knew the situation early and took advantage of the fact that Cao Jun was not here. They took the initiative to ask the envoy Liu Bei to make the Sun and Liu alliance. Zhou Yu recommended Lu Su to Sun Quan before he became critically ill. Then Liu Bei borrowed and occupied Jingzhou and refused to return it. Guan Yu led his troops to drive away the officials appointed by Soochow. Lu Su went to Yiyang and negotiated with Guan Yu. He was generous and well-founded. He finally agreed to cut Xiangshui as the boundary and successfully reclaimed Changsha, Guiyang, and Jiangxia."}

Because of his erudition, he was conscripted as an official. Following the Sima Division's crusade against Wuqiujian's rebellion, Sima Division was killed on the way back to the court, and was used by Sima Zhao instead, in charge of confidentiality and participating in the military. After Zhuge was born in Shouchun, he rebelled and Soochow sent troops to help out. Zhong Hui used a plan to induce Quan Yi to surrender. Therefore, the generals in Shouchun City were suspicious of discord and successfully quelled the unrest. In the battle of Wei Xingbing to destroy Shu, Yu Jiange and Jiang Wei confronted each other, and Deng Aiqi succeeded in attacking Chengdu, and Liu Chan surrendered. Afterwards, Zhong Hui intended to rebel, framed Deng Ai and imprisoned him, planning to join Jiang Wei to send troops to attack Chang'an, and then join forces to trap Luoyang. But then the dissatisfied generals revolted and died in the rebellion. In addition, Zhonghui was very knowledgeable and influenced later generations of metaphysics. He was also good at calligraphy. But there are also books claiming that he was narrow-minded, and Ji Kang died because of offending Zhonghui."}

{"id":28339,"original":"長沙太守。正史記述甚少，亦和《演義》出入極大，諸如韓玄或為黃忠下屬。此外，亦無嗜殺暴虐一說。《三國演義》則稱其為魏將韓浩之兄，赤壁戰後關羽攻長沙，韓玄派黃忠應戰。黃忠與關羽連戰三日，雙方敬彼此是英雄，惺惺相惜。韓玄因而懷疑黃忠通敵，下令斬殺黃忠。此時魏延以殘暴不仁為由反叛，誅殺韓玄。","text":" Changsha prefect. There are very few official history records, and it is also very different from \"The Romance\", such as Han Xuan or Huang Zhong's subordinate. In addition, there is no mention of bloodthirsty and tyranny. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms called him the brother of Wei Jiang Han Hao. After the Chibi War, Guan Yu attacked Changsha, and Han Xuan sent Huang Zhong to fight. Huang Zhong and Guan Yu fought for three days. The two sides respected each other as heroes and cherished each other. Han Xuan therefore suspected that Huang Zhong was collaborating with the enemy and ordered Huang Zhong to be killed. At this time Wei Yan rebelled on the grounds of brutality and punished Han Xuan."}

{"id":28340,"original":"河內郡人，魏國武將。董卓亂政時，曾率兵於盟津與董卓軍相抗，因此揚名。後袁術任其為騎都尉，但並未重用，最後經由夏侯惇引薦而得曹操看重。韓浩在曹軍中是始倡屯田的發起者，經曹操採納，大興屯田。其後終曹魏國祚，幾無缺糧困擾。《三國演義》牽強附會其為韓玄之弟，實則無關。","text":"Hanoi County, Wei State general. During Dong Zhuo's rebellion, he led his troops to fight against Dong Zhuojun in Mengjin and became famous. Later Yuan Shu appointed him as the riding captain, but he did not reuse it. Finally, he was recommended by Xiahou Dun and he was valued by Cao Cao. In the Cao Jun, Han Hao was one of the initiators who initiated the Tuntian, and was adopted by Cao Cao to Daxing Tuntian. Afterwards, Cao Wei Guozuo had almost no food shortage. 'The Romance of the Three Kingdoms' is far-fetched to suggest that he is Han Xuan's younger brother, but it is irrelevant."}

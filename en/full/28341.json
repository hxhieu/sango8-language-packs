{"id":28341,"original":"荊州義陽郡人，劉表屬下。最初被劉表強收為手下，屢次勸建劉表該謹守為臣之道。官渡之戰前，劉表猶豫該從於袁紹或曹操，韓嵩分析利害，力陳曹操優勢，劉表因此派他出使許都。韓嵩臨行前告知劉表，若被獻帝賜位，即為天子之臣，恐無法再仕劉表。至許都後韓嵩果真被朝廷封官侍中、太守，並回到劉表處稱頌朝廷之德，勸劉表遣子入朝。劉表大怒，疑其懷有二心，將韓嵩下獄囚禁。直至曹操獲荊州，韓嵩才獲釋。","text":"A native of Yiyang County, Jingzhou, under Liu Biao. He was initially taken over by Liu Biaoqiang as his subordinate, and repeatedly advised Liu Biao to be a minister. Before the Battle of Guandu, Liu Biao hesitated whether to follow Yuan Shao or Cao Cao. Han Song analyzed the advantages and urged Cao Cao's advantage, so Liu Biao sent him to Xu Du as an envoy. Before leaving, Han Song told Liu Biao that if he was given a position by Emperor Xian, he would be a minister of the emperor, and he might not be able to serve Liu Biao again. After Xu Du, Han Song was indeed appointed by the court to serve as a middle officer and prefect, and returned to Liu Biao to praise the virtues of the court and persuade Liu Biao to send his son to the court. Liu Biao was furious, suspecting that he had two hearts, and imprisoned Han Song. Han Song was not released until Cao Cao was granted Jingzhou."}

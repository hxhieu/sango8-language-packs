He met Liu Bei when he was young, and when the Huangjin Uprising, he followed Liu Bei and fought in all directions. Jian Yong is straightforward, non-trivial, witty and good at speech, and Liu Bei is mostly a lobbyist or messenger. When Liu Bei entered Yizhou, Liu Zhang admired Jianyong very much. In the future, Liu Bei fought against Yizhou, and finally sent Jian Yong to persuade Liu Zhang to surrender. In addition, Jian Yong once persuaded Liu Bei to make fun of him, so that Liu Bei was exempted from severe punishment and harsh law."}

{"id":28349,"original":"荊州義陽人，蜀漢名將。原為劉備部曲，隨劉備入蜀，數有戰功，而被賞識。後劉備封漢中王，破格提拔魏延為漢中太守，令其鎮守北方門戶。魏延善養士卒，勇猛過人，以勇略任，經營漢中時，設「重門之計」布防，令來犯魏軍數度鎩羽而歸，及至蜀漢末期，仍為國門要塞。演義中諸葛亮因魏延有反骨而忌之，與正史相悖。武侯與魏延雖就北伐戰略分歧，但同為蜀漢忠臣，均以大局為重，武侯尤為倚重魏延，凡北伐，幾乎都以魏延為大將，及至病危遺命，都提及：「令延斷後，姜維次之；若延或不從命，軍便自發。」細思其意，可謂對魏延信任有加，更知其必定不會背蜀。然魏延因驕傲自矜，素與楊儀不和，最終被楊儀冠以謀逆罪名誅殺，夷其三族。","text":"Yiyang, Jingzhou, a famous general in Shuhan. It was originally Liu Bei's trilogy, followed by Liu Bei into Shu, and was appreciated for his military exploits. Later Liu Bei was named the king of Hanzhong, and Wei Yan was promoted to the presidency of Hanzhong, making him guard the northern gateway. Wei Yanshan was brave and brave. When he was running Hanzhong, he set up a 'heavy door strategy' for defense, which made the invading Wei army return several times. By the end of the Shu Han Dynasty, he was still a national fortress. In the novel, Zhuge Liang was taboo because of Wei Yan's rebellion, which is contrary to the official history. Although Wuhou and Wei Yan differed on the strategy of the Northern Expedition, they were both loyal ministers of the Shu Han Dynasty, and both focused on the overall situation. Wuhou particularly relied on Wei Yan. In the Northern Expedition, almost all of them regarded Wei Yan as the general. After the break, Jiang Wei came in second; if he delays or fails to follow his orders, the army will spontaneously.' Thinking carefully about the meaning, it can be said that he trusts Wei Yan and knows that he will definitely not back Shu. However, Wei Yan was arrogant and quarreled with Yang Yi, and was eventually accused of conspiracy and murdered by Yang Yi."}

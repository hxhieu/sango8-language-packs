{"id":28351,"original":"襄陽郡人，劉備軍師。龐統號稱「鳳雛」，與「臥龍」諸葛亮齊名，司馬徽讚譽龐統為「南州士之冠冕」。原在周瑜任下擔任功曹，劉備佔荊州後，起用龐統為耒陽令，但龐統不理政務而被免職。魯肅、諸葛亮先後勸劉備重用龐統，劉備從善如流，重新任用龐統。龐統在劉備陣營中僅亞於諸葛亮，後兩人同任軍師中郎將。劉備入蜀，龐統做為隨軍軍師，並為劉備立下攻蜀三大策，臨陣為戰，也多仰賴龐統出謀劃策。可惜進攻雒城時，龐統率軍攻城，中流矢而亡，英才早逝。演義中於赤壁之戰時獻連環船計予曹操，使周瑜火攻得以大獲成功。另，雖演義稱龐統其貌不揚，個性狂妄乖僻，此乃小說家言，不可盡信。","text":" Xiangyang County, Liu Bei army division. Pang Tong was known as the \"Phoenix Young\", and was as famous as \"Wolong\" Zhuge Liang. Sima Hui praised Pang Tong as \"the crown of Nanzhou scholars.\" Originally served as the Cao Cao under Zhou Yu, after Liu Bei occupied Jingzhou, Pang Tong was appointed as Leiyang Order, but Pang Tong was dismissed for ignoring government affairs. Lu Su and Zhuge Liang successively persuaded Liu Bei to reuse Pang Tong, and Liu Bei followed his good faith and reappointed Pang Tong. Pang Tong is only inferior to Zhuge Liang in Liu Bei's camp, and the latter two are both generals in the army. When Liu Bei entered Shu, Pang Tong acted as an army strategist, and he set up three major strategies for attacking Shu for Liu Bei. He also relied on Pang Tong for advice and suggestions. It is a pity that when he attacked Luocheng, Pang Tong led his army to attack the city. During the battle of Chibi in the novel, a series of ships were offered to Cao Cao, which made Zhou Yu's fire attack a great success. In addition, although the novel called Pang Tong's unremarkable appearance and arrogant personality, this is the novelist's words and cannot be trusted."}

{"id":28356,"original":"河東解縣人，蜀漢諸將之首，時人稱「萬人敵」、「威鎮華夏」。劉備招募義軍與黃巾軍相抗時，便已與劉備、張飛相識，三人親若兄弟。後劉備反曹，曹軍攻破下邳、小沛，關羽為保劉備家眷而降曹。曹操得關羽甚喜，雖知曉關羽必不可能忠心歸順，仍待之殊厚，更大讚：「事君不忘其本，天下義士也。」關羽在曹營期間亦與張遼、徐晃交好，又為報曹操禮遇之恩，為曹操陣斬顏良，解了白馬之圍，才掛印而去，重歸劉備麾下。赤壁戰後，劉備入蜀，留關羽假節，鎮守荊州。建安二十四年，關羽率軍從江陵北上，水淹七軍，圍曹仁於樊城，威鎮華夏。然因未提防陸遜、呂蒙，被東吳趁虛攻陷後方，最終敗走麥城，被俘後因不肯降吳，旋即遭到斬首。","text":"A native of Jie County in Hedong, the head of the generals of the Shu Han Dynasty. At that time, it was called \"the enemy of ten thousand people\" and \"Weizhen Huaxia\".

After Liu Bei turned against Cao, Cao Jun attacked Xiapi and Xiaopei, and Guan Yu surrendered Cao to protect Liu Bei's family. Cao Cao was very pleased with Guan Yu. Although he knew that Guan Yu would not be loyal, he still treated him with great honor. He praised it even more"}

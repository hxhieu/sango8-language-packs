During Zhuge Liang's crusade against Nanban, Nanban Wang Meng asked for help from Ugo, and Wu Tugu sent troops to assist. Wu Tu Gu was proud of his invulnerable vine armor soldiers and defeated the Shu soldiers; but in the end, due to his arrogance, he was trapped by the Shu army in Panshe Valley. Zhuge Liang asked Huo Ji to burn Wu Tu bone and all the Ugo soldiers to death."}

{"id":28376,"original":"鮮卑諸部首領之一。素有勇略，深得鮮卑人信重，又接納漢人流民，得習器械之利，更援引漢人軍事法度，令所在部族強盛一時。曹操平定幽州後，軻比能歸順朝廷，但其態度反覆，若中原強盛，則服首稱臣；逢中原動盪，則侵擾犯界，與曹魏關係時有所變。最後被曹魏幽州刺史王雄派人刺殺。史實和演義中相反，非但不曾攻蜀，反倒曾欲與蜀漢聯合攻魏。另，據稱其後人為契丹。","text":"One of the leaders of Xianbei tribes. Known for his bravery and strategy, he has won the trust of the Xianbei people, and he also accepted the Han refugees, acquired the benefits of equipment, and even invoked the military laws of the Han people to make the tribes strong for a while. After Cao Cao calmed down Youzhou, Kebi was able to submit to the court, but his attitude was repeated. If the Central Plains were prosperous, he would take the lead; when the Central Plains were turbulent, he would invade the world, and his relationship with Cao Wei changed from time to time. Finally, he was assassinated by Cao Wei Youzhou Assassin Wang Xiong. Historical facts are contrary to the historical facts. Instead of attacking Shu, they wanted to join forces with Shu Han to attack Wei. In addition, it is said that the follower is Khitan."}

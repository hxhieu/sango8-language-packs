{"id":28377,"original":"幽州遼東人，東漢末年軍閥。因徐榮向董卓舉薦而為遼東太守，甫上任便因昔日有隙而殺襄平令公孫昭以立威，又以嚴刑峻法治下。公孫度先後征討扶餘、高句麗、烏丸、富山賊寇，雄踞遼東。後見中原戰亂，遂自立為遼東侯、平州牧，追封其父為建義侯，出入以及所用器物規制與帝皇無異。曹操曾封其為武威將軍、永寧鄉侯，但公孫度自認已為遼東王，對封賞頗為不屑。","text":"A native of Liaodong, Youzhou, a warlord in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. Because Xu Rong recommended to Dong Zhuo, he was the prefect of Liaodong. As soon as he took office, he killed Xiangping because of the gaps in the past, so that Gongsun Zhao was put under the prestige, and he was under severe punishment. Gongsun Du successively conquered Fuyu, Goguryeo, Karasuma, and Fushan thief, and dominated Liaodong. Later, after seeing the war in the Central Plains, he established himself as Liaodonghou and Pingzhou Mu, and named his father Jianyihou. The rules of entry and exit and the utensils used are no different from the emperor. Cao Cao once named him a general of Wuwei and a lord of Yongning township, but Gongsun Du himself considered himself the king of Liaodong and was quite disdainful of the award."}

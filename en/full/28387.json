Cao Cao wanted to recruit Ding Yi and marry Princess Qinghe to him, but Cao Pi despised Ding Yi for his poor appearance, so he might as well let Princess Qinghe marry Xiahou Dun's son. Ding Yi hated Cao Pi secretly after learning this, and helped Cao Zhi in the prince dispute. But Cao Zhi was addicted to drinking and acted spontaneously. In the end, Cao Cao still took Cao Pi as his son. Cao Pi became the Queen of Wei, so he exterminated Ding Yi from his clan."}

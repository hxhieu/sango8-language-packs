{"id":28412,"original":"涼州天水人，初仕於魏，後歸順蜀。天水之戰時，與姜維一起投降蜀漢，頗受器重。《演義》中，諸葛亮進攻天水前，先遣已歸順於蜀的姜維射箭書入城，以亂軍心。尹賞與梁續是姜維舊友，因而遭太守馬遵猜忌，兩人索性共謀降蜀，大開城門迎蜀軍入天水。","text":"A native of Tianshui, Liangzhou, first served in Wei and later returned to Shunshu. During the Battle of Tianshui, he surrendered to Shu Han with Jiang Wei and was highly regarded. In 'The Romance', before Zhuge Liang attacked Tianshui, he first sent Jiang Wei, who had already returned to Shu, to enter the city with an archery book in order to chaos the army. Yin Shang and Liang Xu were old friends of Jiang Wei, so they were jealous of the prefect Ma Zun. The two simply conspired to descend to Shu and opened the gate to welcome the Shu army into Tianshui."}

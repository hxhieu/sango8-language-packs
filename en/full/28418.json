With his father participating in Wuqiujian's rebellion, Wen Yang charged into battle, causing Sima Shi, whose eye disease had not healed, to catch his eyeballs. Later, Wenqin and his son were repelled by Deng Ai and fled to Wu, but Sima also died on the way back to the imperial court. Later, when Zhuge Dan rebelled, Wen Yang and his father and brother were ordered to lead the army to support. However, Zhuge Dan actually killed Wen Qin who was not in harmony with him. In desperation, Wen Yang and his younger brother Wen Hu had no choice but to switch to Sima Zhao.

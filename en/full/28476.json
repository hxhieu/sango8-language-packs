{"id":28476,"original":"豫州沛國人，曹魏將領。其事跡僅見於《魏略》中。少壯時就跟隨曹操，有任俠之風，但為人謹慎，以忠勇聞名。曹操讓其掌管禁衛或出任監軍，可見對其相當信賴。曾從曹操麾下諸將討眭固，官渡之戰亦有戰功，但之後幾無存世紀錄。","text":"Yuzhou Peiguo, general Cao Wei. His deeds can only be seen in 'Wei Lue'. When he was young, he followed Cao Cao, and he was a hero, but he was cautious and famous for his loyalty. Cao Cao allowed him to take charge of the guards or serve as the prison guards, which shows that he trusts him very much. He once sought Xuangu from the generals under Cao Cao's command. He also had military exploits in the battle of Guandu, but there were few records in the century afterwards."}

{"id":28477,"original":"晉武帝之子、晉惠帝之弟。八王之亂中的其中一路諸侯王，但相較其餘野心家，司馬乂傾向忠於朝廷，先後抗拒司馬冏、司馬顒、司馬穎。司馬乂雖掌權，但不專斷，接受朝臣之議，試圖主動與司馬穎和解，以安天下。但司馬穎要求誅殺數名大臣，司馬乂拒絕，再度兵戎相見。司馬乂堅守都成，城內雖有饑荒，但將士一心，士氣仍舊高昂。可司馬越誤判情勢，讓惠帝下詔奪去司馬乂兵權，囚禁於金鏞城，數日後受火刑而死。","text":"Son of Emperor Wu of Jin and brother of Emperor Hui of Jin. Among the princes and kings in the Eight Kings Rebellion, Sima Yi tended to be loyal to the court compared with other careerists, and resisted Sima Yan, Sima Yong, and Sima Ying successively. Although Sima Yi is in power, he is not arbitrary, accepts the courtier's proposal, and tries to reconcile with Sima Ying on his own initiative to settle the world. However, Sima Ying asked to kill several ministers, but Sima Yi refused and met again. Sima Yi insisted on defending the capital. Although there was a famine in the city, the soldiers were united and morale remained high. But Sima Yue misjudged the situation and asked Emperor Hui to issue an edict to seize Sima Yi's military power, imprisoned in Jinyong City, and died by fire a few days later."}

He has a gentle personality and is known for his talent. After Sima Yan became Emperor Wu of Jin in the Wei Dynasty, he was named King of Qi, assisting the government, planning military affairs, and treating the people of the country well. The name of benevolence and virtue is well-known in the world. Sima Yan delegated powers to the kings to choose the official officials of the country. Sima Youxu was worried that the kings would sit up and he had written to oppose it, but Emperor Wu never adopted it. Then there was the Eight Kings Rebellion. Isn't it accidental? After the extermination of Wu, Emperor Wu of the Jin Dynasty was getting worse and worse. The officials in the court wanted to succeed Sima You, but Sima Yan’s favorite ministers Xun Xu, Feng Du and others had gaps with Sima You, so they wanted Emperor Wu to issue an edict to Sima You. When he returned to the country, Sima You became anxious and sick. The imperial doctor arbitrarily speculated about Sima Yan's mind, saying that he was not sick, not diagnosed and treated, and even died of vomiting blood."}

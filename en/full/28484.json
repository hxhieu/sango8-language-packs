Before Emperor Wu of Jin died, Qi Yang Jun and Sima Liang were appointed as auxiliary ministers. However, Yang Jun wanted to take over the power and eradicate Sima Liang. However, he was eliminated first by Jananfeng and Simawei, the king of Chu. Sima Liang is the Minister of Regent. Because Sima Liang was jealous of Sima Wei holding a heavy soldier in his hand and wanted to seize his military power, Jian Nanfeng saw it through and made the preemptive strike, so that Emperor Hui issued an edict against Sima Liang and ordered Sima Wei to send soldiers to arrest him. Sima Liang consciously had a clear conscience, and he was arrested, but Sima Weixu used a heavy profit to make the soldiers kill Sima Liang."}

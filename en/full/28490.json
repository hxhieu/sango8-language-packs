{"id":28490,"original":"晉惠帝，晉武帝之子。普遍認為其資質不佳，甚至可謂愚昧，後世王夫之更評其為「土木偶人」。武帝擔憂晉惠帝不堪重任，多次考驗，但在太子妃賈南風及張泓等謀臣的獻策下成功蒙騙武帝。但即位後弊端即顯，無法處理政要，賈南風把權，加之武帝時任由諸侯親王坐大，以致發生八王之亂，西晉亦因此快速衰亡。最終疑被東海王司馬越毒殺。曾有人向其報告百姓因飢荒無米可食，晉惠帝反問：「何不食肉糜？」，因而成為昏君的典範，甚至連其諡號「惠」在此之後亦被視做昏君之屬，歷朝帝王多避免使用。","text":" Emperor Hui of Jin, son of Emperor Wu of Jin. It is generally believed that his qualifications are poor, and even ignorant. Later Wang Fuzhi even commented on him as a \"civil puppet.\" Emperor Wu was worried that Emperor Hui of Jin would be unbearable and tried many times, but he was successfully deceived under the advice of his advisers such as Crown Princess Jian Nanfeng and Zhang Hong. However, the disadvantages became obvious after he came to the throne, unable to deal with politicians, Jia Nanfeng took power, and when Emperor Wu let the princes and princes sit up, the Eight Kings Rebellion occurred and the Western Jin Dynasty quickly declined. Suspected of being poisoned by Sima Yue, king of the East China Sea. Someone once reported to him that the people had no rice to eat because of the famine. Emperor Hui Jin asked, \"Why not eat meat?\" He became a model of the faint emperor, and even his posthumous name \"Hui\" was later regarded as a genus of the faint emperor. Most emperors in the past avoid using it."}

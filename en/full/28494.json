{"id":28494,"original":"晉惠帝司馬衷之子。晉惠帝即位後冊立其為皇太子，幼時便極為聰慧，甚得晉武帝司馬炎寵愛，甚至一說晉惠帝之所以得繼承帝位，便是由於武帝對司馬遹寄予厚望。但司馬遹年歲漸長後，荒廢學業，在賈南風刻意推波助瀾之下，司馬遹所行越發脫序。之後賈南風見時機成熟，讓惠帝下詔廢司馬遹為庶人。最後因趙王司馬倫與賈南風爭權，使計讓賈南風殺死司馬遹，再以為太子報仇的大義討伐賈南風。","text":"The son of Jin Huidi Sima Zhong. After Emperor Hui of Jin ascended the throne, he was enrolled as the crown prince. He was extremely intelligent when he was young, and he was very much favored by Emperor Wu of Jin Sima Yan. It was even said that Emperor Hui of Jin inherited the throne because Emperor Wu had high hopes for Sima Xiao. However, as Sima Hu got older, he abandoned his studies. With Jiananfeng's deliberate promotion, Sima Hu's behavior became more and more out of order. After Jiananfeng saw that the time was right, Emperor Hui sent an edict to abolish Sima Xu as a common man. In the end, Simalun, the king of Zhao, was fighting for power with Jiananfeng, so that Jiananfeng was asked to kill Sima Dun, and then he thought that the crown prince would avenge him."}

{"id":28503,"original":"右北平無終人。原為幽州牧劉虞手下從事，奉命前往朝廷勤皇，回返時劉虞已被公孫瓚殺害。田疇不願為公孫瓚做事，便率族人隱居徐無山，又開學講經，吸引附近百姓，甚至烏丸、鮮卑等外族皆慕名而來。後來袁紹崛起，數次徵召，田疇也拒不出仕。直到曹操征伐烏丸，田疇才出山為曹操軍擔任嚮導，幫助曹操打贏白狼山之戰。田疇立下大功，曹操數度上表封賞田疇，又派與田疇相善的夏侯惇勸說，都為田疇所拒，最後田疇只接受議郎這等無權的閒職。","text":" You Beiping has no end. Originally engaged by Liu Yu of Youzhou Mu, he was ordered to go to the imperial court Qinhuang. When he returned, Liu Yu was killed by Gongsun Zan. Tian Chou was unwilling to do things for Gongsun Zan, so he led his clan to live in Xu Wushan, and began to give lectures, attracting nearby people, even Wuwan, Xianbei and other foreigners. Later, Yuan Shao rose up and was called up several times, but Tian Chou couldn't refuse to serve. It was not until Cao Cao conquered Karasuma that Tian Chou came out to serve as a guide for Cao Cao's army, helping Cao Cao win the battle of White Wolf Mountain. Tian Chou made great contributions, and Cao Cao gave Tian Chou several times, and sent Xiahou Dun, who was kind to Tian Chou, to persuade him. Tian Chou refused. In the end Tian Chou only accepted Yilang and other unauthorised idle jobs."}

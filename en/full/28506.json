It was originally a tyrant in the Shangyong area and claimed to Cao Cao, but was defeated by Meng Da and Liu Feng and surrendered to Liu Bei. After the defeat, Guan Yu and Meng Da rebelled against Shu and voted for Wei. Before he voted for Wei, he led his troops to defeat Liu Feng, so he became the Marquis. After Mengda wanted to turn back, Shen Yi immediately reported to Sima Yi. After Mengda was destroyed, Sima Yi used Shen Yi to engrave the official seal letter without authorization to inquire about the crime. Shen Yi was removed from his post and sent back to the DPRK. The record is unknown."}

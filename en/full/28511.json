{"id":28511,"original":"山陽郡高平縣人，東漢、曹魏官員。與王充、王符並稱後漢三賢。其人善於文辭，直率敢言，行為不羈，因荀彧推舉而出仕。仲長統提倡以「人事為本」，不任天命，反對愚忠愚孝，與曹操諸多理念相合，但卻並未受到重用。","text":"A native of Gaoping County, Shanyang County, an official of the Eastern Han Dynasty and Cao Wei. Together with Wang Chong and Wang Fu, they are called the Three Heroes of the Later Han Dynasty. He is good at literary, outspoken, unruly behavior, and was elected official by Xun Yu. Zhong Changtong advocated a 'personnel-oriented' principle, not letting God's mandate, opposing foolishness, loyalty, and filial piety. This is consistent with Cao Cao's many ideas, but has not been reused."}

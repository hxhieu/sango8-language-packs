{"id":28522,"original":"揚州吳郡人，全琮長子。少時即有盛名。芍陂之戰，全緒、全端、張休、顧承抗魏有功，各有封賞。但全端、全緒認為自己該居首功，為爭功勞，加上二宮之爭分屬不同派系，向孫權誣陷誹謗顧承、張休，導致顧承被貶、張休被賜自盡。東興之戰，全緒與丁奉共同上書，建議引兵先出，佔據要地。吳軍在此役大獲全勝，全緒因功封為亭侯。","text":"Yangzhou Wujun, the eldest son of Quan Cong. It is famous when you are young. In the battle of Shaopei, Quanxu, Quanduan, Zhang Xiu, Gu Chengkang and Wei Yougong, each had their own rewards. However, Quan Duan and Quan Xu believed that they should be the first to take the lead. In order to fight for credit, and the Second House of War belonged to different factions, they framed and slandered Gu Cheng and Zhang Xiu against Sun Quan, resulting in Gu Cheng being demoted and Zhang Xiu being given suicide. In the battle of Dongxing, Quanxu and Ding Feng jointly wrote a letter, suggesting that the troops should be brought out first and occupy the important land. Wu Jun won a complete victory in this campaign, and Quan Xu was named Tinghou for his merits."}

{"id":28575,"original":"濟陰人，曹魏官員。因博通文學，與曹操諸子交好，特別是與曹丕有深交。曹丕爭奪世子之位時，吳質曾為其謀事。曹丕流傳於世的《與吳質書》，便是一篇文情並茂的散文；而吳質回信亦是如此。吳質雖被曹丕重用，但因驕矜無禮，而不為時人所喜，史料中便有記載他以曹真、朱鑠取笑為樂。","text":"Jiyin people, Cao Wei officials. Because of Broadcom literature, he had a good relationship with Cao Cao's sons, especially Cao Pi. When Cao Pi was vying for the place of the world's son, Wu Zhi had worked for him. Cao Pi's 'A Letter to Wu Zhi', which is handed down to the world, is a prose with rich sentiment; this is also true of Wu Zhi's reply. Although Wu Zhi was reused by Cao Pi, he was not liked by the time because of his arrogance and rudeness. Historical materials have recorded that he used Cao Zhen and Zhu Shuo to make fun of him."}

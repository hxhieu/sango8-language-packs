{"id":28580,"original":"曹操故人。曹操為躲避董卓徵招，逃歸故里途中經過呂伯奢家。呂伯奢一家殷勤款待曹操，但曹操反疑心呂家別有所圖，趁夜殺害呂伯奢一家後逃逸，更嘆道：「寧我負人，毋人負我！」。此事傳世版本甚多，但基本上都源於曹操疑心生暗鬼之故。《魏略》所記雖截然不同，但恐為避諱虛構而杜撰。","text":" Cao Cao's deceased. In order to avoid Dong Zhuo, Cao Cao passed Lu Boshe's house on his way back to his hometown. The Lu Boshe family treated Cao Cao graciously, but Cao Cao was against the suspicion that the Lu family had no plans. He escaped after killing the Lu Boshe family at night, and sighed, \"I would rather bear others than others!\" Many versions of this matter have been handed down to the world, but most of them all stemmed from Cao Cao's suspicion that he was a ghost. Although the records in \"Wei Lue\" are completely different, they are afraid to make up for avoiding fiction."}

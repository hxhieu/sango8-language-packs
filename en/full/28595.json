When Cao Cao attacked Lu Bu, Li Feng and Xue Lan were ordered to station in Juye. The two tried to surrender Cao Cao’s general Li Gan. Li Gan refused, so they were besieged. Later Li Qian’s son Li Zheng led his army to defeat Lu Bujun and cut the two in battle. In other words, the two fled and returned to the original formation, but were executed by Lu Bu because of their defeat."}

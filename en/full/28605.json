{"id":28605,"original":"犍為武陽人，原為蜀漢官員，後出仕西晉。事祖母孝順，更以《陳情表》一文流傳千古。為譙周門下生，少時以聰明機辯揚名，曾數次為蜀漢出使孫吳。仕晉後，為官正直嚴厲，名聲頗佳，但一直未得入朝重用。在赴任漢中太守前，因賦詩中有怨懟之言，被晉武帝免官。","text":" Qian was from Wuyang, originally an official of the Shu Han Dynasty, and later served as an official in the Western Jin Dynasty. It is the grandmother's filial piety, and the article \"Chen Qing Biao\" has been passed down through the ages. In order to give birth to Qiao Zhou, when he was a little boy, he defended his fame with cleverness. He served as the envoy of Shu Han to Sun Wu several times. After being promoted, he was upright and strict as an official and had a good reputation, but he had never been reused in the court. Before he became the prefect of Hanzhong, he was dismissed by Emperor Wu of Jin due to complaints in his poems."}

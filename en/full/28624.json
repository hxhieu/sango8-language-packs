When Cao Cao quelled Hebei and conquered Wuhuan in the north, the surrendered high-ranking cadres rebelled in Bingzhou. The situation in Hedong was chaotic. Xun Yu recommended Du Ji as the prefect. Du Ji conquered counties with resourcefulness, and then settled the walls and cleared the fields, leaving the rebels with nothing. After Cao Jun successfully put down the rebellion, Du Ji's work was done. During his tenure, Du Ji promoted governance by doing nothing, rewarded farming, and promoted education. Hedong became rich and provided a lot of food for Cao Jun on several occasions. After Cao Cao was named Wei Gong, he invited Du Ji back to the court. After Cao Pi succeeded to the throne, Du Ji was also heavily used and appointed Du Ji to supervise building and shipbuilding. However, when the boat was first completed, it was caught in a strong wind and sank. Unfortunately, Du Ji died."}

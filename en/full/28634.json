{"id":28634,"original":"孫吳將領。西晉自巴蜀南下攻吳，孫皓命張悌率兵抵抗。沈瑩料定荊州必失，諫言張悌固守牛渚，但不為採納，後吳軍兵敗，張悌、沈瑩俱皆被殺。沈瑩於水文地理研究頗有建樹，著有《臨海水土異物志》。現代部分學者認為該書中所載的「夷州」，即是台灣。","text":"General Sun Wu. The Western Jin Dynasty attacked Wu from the south of Bashu, Sun Hao ordered Zhang Ti to lead his troops to resist. Shen Ying expected that Jingzhou would be lost. Zhang Ti insisted on defending Niu Zhu, but he did not accept it. After Wu Jun was defeated, both Zhang Ti and Shen Ying were killed. Shen Ying has made great achievements in the study of hydrogeography, and is the author of 'A Record of Foreign Objects in Sea Water'. Some modern scholars believe that the 'Yizhou' contained in the book is Taiwan."}

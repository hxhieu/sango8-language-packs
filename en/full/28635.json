The 'Jiang Biao Biography' states that he was originally a slave to Sun Quan. Because of his loyalty and integrity, he was appreciated by Sun Quan and became his guardian. In the battle of Xiaoyaojin, Soochow was defeated, and Sun Quan retreated to Xiaoshiqiao, unable to cross because of the broken bridge. Gu Li followed closely, helping Sun Quan to spur the horse, and just jumped over the broken bridge and was spared."}

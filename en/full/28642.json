{"id":28642,"original":"陳留己吾人，典韋之子，曹魏官員。曹操因痛惜典韋之死，對典滿照拂有加，先推薦典滿入朝擔任郎中，不久又因思念典韋，將典滿調任隨軍司馬，幾如養子。曹操過世後，曹丕待典滿依舊，調任都尉，又加封關內侯。關內侯乃漢代二十等爵制次高者，典滿以功臣之後得此封賞，可見曹氏父子對典韋感恩之情歷久不衰。","text":" Chen Liuji, my son, Dian Wei's son, Cao Wei official. Cao Cao deplored Dianwei's death, and had a lot of gratification for Dianman. He first recommended Dianman to join the dynasty as a doctor. Soon after he missed Dianwei, he transferred Dianman to the army, almost like an adopted son. After Cao Cao's death, Cao Pi waited until the fullness of the law was still there, and was transferred to the post of captain, and then sealed off the court. Guan Nei Hou was the second highest nobility in the 20th class in the Han Dynasty. Dian Man was awarded this award after being a hero, which shows that the Cao family's gratitude to Dian Wei lasts for a long time."}

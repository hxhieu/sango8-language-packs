{"id":28656,"original":"汝南西平人，曹魏官員。因中原戰亂，與家人避禍荊州，得劉表厚待。但和洽看穿劉表老年昏聵，再度南下武陵。直到劉琮降曹後，和洽才應曹操辟命出仕。後曹操征漢中，和洽最早提議遷漢中之民入關隴等地。曹操初未納其言，但因與劉備戰況膠著，最終依計行事。而劉備雖得漢中，卻無實際人口收益，多少也影響蜀漢國力發展。","text":" Xiping from Runan, Cao Wei official. Because of the war in the Central Plains, he and his family avoided Jingzhou, so Liu Biao was kindly treated. But He Qia sees through Liu Biao's old age and faint, and once again heads south to Wuling. It was not until Liu Cong surrendered to Cao that He Qia was appointed by Cao Cao. After Cao Cao conquered Hanzhong, He Qia first proposed to move the people of Hanzhong to Guanlong and other places. Cao Cao did not accept his words at first, but due to the stalemate with Liu Bei, he finally acted according to plan. Although Liu Bei won Hanzhong, he had no real population gains, which also affected the development of Shuhan's national strength."}

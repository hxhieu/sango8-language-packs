He Jin conspired to kill the eunuch and summoned Dong Zhuo to enter Beijing, but He Jin was suspicious and sent the seed to proclaim the edict to stop Dong Zhuo. If Dong Zhuo refused to comply, the seed angered Dong Zhuo and ordered Dong Zhuo to return to the Sunset Pavilion. After Dong Zhuo took power, whether it was to demote the official far away, or to show goodwill with the high-ranking official's generous pay, the seedlings would not follow their orders. After Dong Zhuo's defeat, Li Wei and Guo Bin took the power, so they contacted Ma Teng and Han Sui with Ma Yu and Liu Fan as internal responses. They attacked Li Wei and Guo Bin, but they were defeated and killed."}

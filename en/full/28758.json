{"id":28758,"original":"吳郡富春人，東吳宗室。孫策、孫權的堂弟，得孫權信任，率領孫吳軍精兵，多次在合肥、濡須抵抗曹軍。後接替程普督夏口要衝。孫皎有容人雅量，甚有人望。與甘寧曾有衝突，但隨即在孫權勸說下認錯交好；又令吳軍士兵不可擅自俘虜曹魏平民，此舉讓江淮一帶民心歸附，投吳者眾。後孫權意圖趁關羽北伐之際奪取荊州，曾想讓呂蒙和孫皎為左右都督，可見其才應為當時宗室中最傑出者。","text":"A native of Fuchun, Wu Jun, a clan of the Eastern Wu. Sun Ce and Sun Quan's cousins, who were trusted by Sun Quan, led Sun Wujun's elite soldiers and resisted Cao Jun in Hefei and Ruxu many times. After succeeding Cheng Pudu, Xiakou will rush. Sun Jiao is tolerant and generous, and is very popular. There was a conflict with Gan Ning, but he immediately confessed his mistake under Sun Quan's persuasion; and ordered Wu Jun soldiers not to capture the civilians of Cao Wei without authorization. This move made the people of Jianghuai be attached to the Wu people. Later grandson Quan intended to take advantage of Guan Yu's Northern Expedition to seize Jingzhou. He wanted to make Lu Meng and Sun Jiao the governors of the left and right, which shows that they should be the most outstanding in the clan at that time."}

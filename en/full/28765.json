The official worshiped General Hussein, the captain of Lexiang. When the general of the Western Jin Dynasty, Du Yu, attacked Wu, Sun Xin saw that the enemy's vanguard had only 800 men, so he boldly confronted him. When the enemy army was touched and collapsed, Sun Xin believed that the opportunity was indispensable and immediately landed to pursue it. Unexpectedly, the Jin army had long been ambushing, and Sun Xin fought hard to break the siege and led the remnants back to the city. I was about to breathe a sigh of relief. I didn't think that the remnant army was mixed with the spies of the Jin army. Seeing that the city gate was opened, he immediately cut Sun Xin under the horse."}

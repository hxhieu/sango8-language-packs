{"id":28767,"original":"太原中都人，曹魏重臣。曹操曾數度徵辟，欲任用孫資，孫資皆因故未能出仕。深受曹丕、曹叡器重，明帝時為朝中元老重臣之一，常為曹叡出謀劃策，屢有建樹。但其推舉司馬懿為託孤輔政大臣之舉，後世史學家如裴松之等，多認為其乃出自私心，而此舉亦是導致魏國皇室大權旁落、快速衰亡之因。","text":"A native of Taiyuan Zhongdu, Cao Wei Zhongchen. Cao Cao had recruited several times and wanted to appoint Sun Tzu, but Sun Tzu was unable to go into office for some reason. He was highly valued by Cao Pi and Cao Rui. During the Ming Dynasty, he was one of the elders and ministers of the central government. He often made suggestions for Cao Rui and made many achievements. However, his move to recommend Sima Yi as the assistant minister of the Tuogu, later historians such as Pei Songzhi, most believed that it was selfishness, and this move was also the cause of the rapid decline and decline of Wei's imperial power."}

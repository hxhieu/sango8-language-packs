{"id":28771,"original":"吳郡富春人，本名俞韶，跟孫堅家族是姻親，相當於被孫策認為義子，故改姓孫。孫韶十七歲時，江東遭遇重大叛亂，孫權的弟弟孫翊與堂兄弟孫河被刺。孫權命令孫韶接管孫河的部隊，負責駐守吳郡。孫權平亂後試探夜襲孫韶，但守軍有條不紊，由是重用孫韶為徐州防線主將。孫權稱帝後，封為鎮北將軍。常年駐守孫吳北方邊境，整軍防備尤重情報，故而百戰不殆。","text":" A native of Wujun Fuchun, whose real name is Yu Shao, is related to Sun Jian's family, which is equivalent to being considered a righteous son by Sun Ce, so his surname was changed to Sun. When Sun Shao was seventeen years old, Jiangdong encountered a major rebellion, and Sun Quan's younger brother Sun Yi and cousin Sun He were assassinated. Sun Quan ordered Sun Shao to take over Sun He's troops and be responsible for stationing in Wu County. After the chaos, Sun Quanping tried to attack Sun Shao at night, but the defenders were methodical, so Sun Shao was reused as the main general of the Xuzhou defense line. After Sun Quan became emperor, he was named General Zhenbei. Perennially stationed at the northern border of Sun Wu, the whole army is guarded especially by intelligence, so a hundred battles are not lost."}

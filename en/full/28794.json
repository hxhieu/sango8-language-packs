{"id":28794,"original":"城陽東武城人，賈南風乳母。正史上幾無事蹟，目前所知出自墓誌銘《晉賈皇后乳母美人徐氏之銘》。文中稱楊駿專權時，太后楊芷招皇后賈南風入宮，意圖殺害賈南風，徐義藉故請賈南風離開，賈南風因而得以倖免。但此記載多處和正史出入極大，尤以楊太后密謀誅殺賈南風一事。在賈南風為太子妃時，楊氏多次勸諫賈南風，又在武帝面前保全她。","text":" Chengyang Tobu city native, Janan wind nurse. There are few deeds in the official history, and it is currently known from the epitaph \"The Inscription of the Queen of Jin Jia's Nursery and Beauty Xu\". It is said in the article that when Yang Jun was dictating power, the empress dowager Yang Zhi recruited Queen Jananfeng into the palace with the intention of killing Jananfeng. Xu Yi asked Jia Nanfeng to leave, and Jananfeng was spared. However, this record differs greatly from the official history in many places, especially the Queen Mother Yang conspired to kill Jananfeng. When Jia Nanfeng was the crown prince, the Yang family advised Jia Nanfeng many times and saved her in front of Emperor Wu."}

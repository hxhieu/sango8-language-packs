{"id":28806,"original":"上黨人，曹魏將領。隨于禁救援襄樊，兵敗後被關羽軍俘虜，關羽敗亡後，被孫權軍擄獲，之後又被送返曹魏。因孫權待浩周頗為禮遇，浩周數度在曹丕面前為孫權美言。但因遣子入魏為質一事孫權態度反復，惹怒曹丕，浩周也因此被疏遠，終生不得重用。","text":" Shangdang member, General Cao Wei. Following the ban to rescue Xiangfan, he was captured by the Guan Yu army after the defeat. After Guan Yu was defeated, he was captured by the Sun Quan army and then sent back to Cao Wei. Because Sun Quan treated Hao Zhou quite courteously, Hao Zhou several times spoke for Sun Quan in front of Cao Pi. However, Sun Quan's repeated attitudes caused Cao Pi to be irritated by sending his sons to Wei, and Hao Zhou was therefore alienated and could not be reused for life."}

During Zhuge Liang's first Northern Expedition, Ma Zunzheng followed Yongzhou Governor Guo Huai and led his officials Jiang Wei and others on a patrol. On the way, he heard that Zhuge Liang came to attack, and many Cao Wei officials had secretly communicated with Zhuge Liang. Guo Huai believed that he should immediately switch to Shangyu, but Jiang Wei believed that it was impossible. Ma Zun determined that Jiang Wei had collided with the enemy, and after returning to Shangyu, he closed the city gate and prevented Jiang Wei from entering the city. Jiang Wei had no way out and finally surrendered to Shu Han."}

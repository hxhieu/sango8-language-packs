{"id":28862,"original":"清河郡人，原屬袁紹，後歸曹操。昔袁紹縱容手下掘墳盜墓以充軍資，崔琰便曾諫言不可為之，並應為曝屍者收殮屍骨，方是仁德之舉；亦曾勸阻袁紹不要發動官渡之戰。袁紹死後，袁譚和袁尚相爭，都徵招崔琰，崔琰託病推辭，被問罪下獄險死。崔琰初仕曹操，便直陳曹操不該以得甲兵為喜，而應當注重民生，救民於荼炭。崔琰由此而得到曹操敬重。崔琰正直儒雅，為當時名士，陳壽於《三國志》稱其：「崔琰高格最優。」最後卻因無心之論冒犯曹操，又被奸佞誣陷，而遭賜死。","text":" Qinghe County native, originally belonged to Yuan Shao, later returned to Cao Cao. Once Yuan Shao condoned his subordinates to dig graves and robbers to replenish their military resources, Cui Yan once admonished that he should not do it, and it was a benevolent act to collect the bones of those who exposed the corpse; he also discouraged Yuan Shao from launching the battle of Guandu. After Yuan Shao's death, Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang quarreled, and both recruited Cui Yan. Cui Yan turned down because of his illness, and was accused of dying in jail. When Cui Yan first served as Cao Cao, he straightened out that Cao Cao should not be pleased by winning soldiers, but should pay attention to people's livelihood and save the people in Tutan. Cui Yan was respected by Cao Cao for this. Cui Yan was upright and elegant, and was a celebrity at the time. Chen Shouyu said in \"Three Kingdoms\""}

At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the epidemic was rampant and many people in Zhang Zhongjing's family died as a result. He determined to study medicine and eventually became a generation of famous doctors. He also summed up his lifelong learning in his book \"Treatise on Febrile and Miscellaneous Diseases.\" This book is the first collection of principles, methods, prescriptions, and medicines in the history of traditional Chinese medicine. It has a huge influence on later generations, such as Sun Simiao in the Tang Dynasty, Ye Tianshi in the Qing Dynasty, and even Korea and Japan have many famous doctors studying. Because of his superb medical skills, Zhang Zhongjing was called the \"Three Magic Doctors of Jian'an\" together with Dong Feng and Hua Tuo. He was also listed as the four famous Chinese doctors with Bian Que, Hua Tuo and Li Shizhen, and he was regarded as the \"Sage of Medicine\" during the Yuan and Ming Dynasties."}

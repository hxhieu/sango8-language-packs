When Liu Bei attacked Yizhou, Liu Zhang ordered him to lead his army to resist Zhang Fei. After the defeat, he used him as an envoy to ask Liu Bei to surrender. After Liu Bei's death, Yong Kai, Gao Ding and Zhu Bao voted for Wu in the Nanzhong Rebellion, captured Zhang Yi and sent them to Soochow. After Wu Shu rebuilt the old one, Zhuge Liang sent Deng Zhi as an envoy to redeem Zhang Yi. At this time, Sun Quan knew Zhang Yi and he was greatly appreciated after talking. After Zhang Yi returned to China, Sun Quan was even more regretful."}

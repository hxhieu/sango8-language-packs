The Ming emperor Cao Rui met with him. After the Ming emperor ascended the throne, he first named Cao Yu as king and then recruited as an official in the court. When the Ming emperor was dying, he wanted to use Cao Yu as his minister, but Cao Yu resolutely resigned. After that, the power of the Wei State was successively controlled by the power ministers Cao Shuang and the Sima family, and it cannot be said that it has nothing to do with Cao Yu."}

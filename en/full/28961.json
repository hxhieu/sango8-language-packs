{"id":28961,"original":"沛國譙縣人，魏國將領，許褚之子。魏滅蜀之戰時，鍾會命令許儀為先鋒開路，自己率軍緊隨其後，途經一橋，鍾會坐騎馬蹄卡於橋縫中，之後鍾會以許儀未盡先鋒整治道路之責，以軍法處死。此過甚小，其罪不當論斬，魏國上下因此駭然。後世史家認為，因許氏父子忠於曹氏，而當時掌權者為司馬一族，鍾會熱衷於攀附權貴，故殺許儀向司馬家示好。","text":" Peiguo Qiao County, general Wei Guo, son of Xu Chu. During the battle between Wei and Shu, Zhonghui ordered Xu Yi to open the way for the vanguard. He led his army to follow behind. After passing a bridge, Zhonghui sat on his horse and got stuck in the cracks of the bridge. After that, Zhonghui took Xu Yi's responsibility as a pioneer to clean up the road. , Executed by military law. This was too small, and his crime was improperly cut, so Wei Guoshang was shocked. Later historians believed that because Xu's father and son were loyal to the Cao family, and the Sima clan was in power at the time, Zhong Hui was keen to cling to the powerful, so he killed Xu Yi to show his favor to the Sima family."}

{"id":28972,"original":"豫州汝南人，蜀漢大將。追隨劉備許久，忠勇不遜於趙雲，同列「四征將軍」，但相關史料大多亡佚不可考。劉備在豫州時，陳到應已投靠其麾下，所轄部隊乃劉備禁衛精兵「白眊」，諸葛亮曾稱白眊兵為「西方上兵」。長坂坡之戰，便是依靠白眊兵，劉備才能順利撤退；夷陵大敗時，斷後部隊也可能是白眊兵。另有一說，白眊兵為出自西南少數民族「青羌五部」的精兵，應是劉備入蜀後才設立。陳到在劉備死後與李嚴鎮守白帝城，又領永安都督，兩地俱為蜀漢險要，可見其足堪重任。《演義》雖無提及其名，但後世史家認為《演義》與諸多野史中，許多趙雲的功績，實際上可能是陳到所為。","text":"A native of Runan, Yuzhou, a general of Shuhan. Following Liu Bei for a long time, he is not inferior to Zhao Yun in loyalty and courage, and is listed as the 'Four Generals', but most of the relevant historical materials are lost and untestable. When Liu Bei was in Yuzhou, Chen Daoying had already taken refuge under him. The troops under his jurisdiction were Liu Bei's elite guards 'Bai Yu'. Zhuge Liang once called the white soldiers 'Western soldiers.' In the battle of Changbanpo, Liu Bei was able to retreat smoothly by relying on white soldiers; when Yiling was defeated, the troops after the break might also be white soldiers. Another said that the Baixian soldiers were elite soldiers from the 'Five Tribes of Qing and Qiang' ethnic minorities in the southwest. They should have been established after Liu Bei entered Shu. After Liu Bei's death, Chen Dao and Li Yan guarded the Baidi City and led the Yongan Governor. Both places were critically important in the Shu Han, which shows that he is worthy of an important task. Although the name is not mentioned in 'The Romance', historians of later generations believe that many of Zhao Yun's achievements in 'The Romance' and many unofficial histories may actually be Chen Dawei."}

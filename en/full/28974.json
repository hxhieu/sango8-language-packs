He was upright and filial. After his father died in battle, Chen Biao joined the army. He was very popular because of his kind treatment to the soldiers. Later, a rebellion broke out in Soochow, and Chen Biao said that his military situation was urgent and sent troops across the border to quell the rebellion without waiting for orders. Due to the special political environment of the Soochow Wu, neither Sun Quan nor the Grand General Lu Xun blamed Chen Biao, but reused it.

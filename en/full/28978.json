{"id":28978,"original":"汝南郡人，蜀漢官員，名士許靖的孫姪兒，一說姪兒。年輕時就非常有才華，深得當時蜀漢尚書令費禕欣賞。費禕當上大將軍之後，更將陳祗破格拔擢為侍中，作為後主劉禪的親信。其後尚書令空缺，費禕便任命陳祗代理。一般評價認為陳祗勾結宦官，是令蜀漢敗亡的罪人。但由於長期受到費禕的愛護，陳祗其實也是堅定的北伐支持派，更曾力保姜維，功過難斷。此外，陳祗精於易卜相術等雜藝。","text":" A native of Runan County, an official of the Han Dynasty, the grandson of the celebrity Xu Jing.

Generally speaking, Chen Zhi colluded with the eunuch and was the sinner who caused the defeat of the Shu Han. However, due to the long-term love of Fei Yi, Chen Yi was also a staunch supporter of the Northern Expedition. He even tried his best to protect Jiang Wei. In addition, Chen Yi is good at acrobatics such as Ibu Xiangshu."}

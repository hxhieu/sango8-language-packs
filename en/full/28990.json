{"id":28990,"original":"丹楊秣陵人，歷事孫吳、西晉。孫皓時交州發生叛亂，官員殺害交阯太守並投降西晉。陶璜自表討賊，初接戰敗退，但陶璜當晚展開夜襲扳回一城，又走海路奇襲交阯，不但識破伏兵之計，更巧妙離間敵軍，取得優勢。孫皓遂命陶璜接任交州牧，在當地與西晉展開長期對抗。東吳降晉後，晉武帝曾想趁機收回州牧手握重兵，但因林邑國時常犯境，最終未刪減交州的兵員。","text":" Danyang Moling people, history of Sun Wu, Western Jin Dynasty. When Sun Hao rebelled in Jiaozhou, officials killed the prefect and surrendered to the Western Jin Dynasty. Tao Huang showed himself to be a thief and was defeated for the first time, but Tao Huang launched a night attack that night to regain a city, and then took a surprise attack by sea. Not only did he see through the ambush, he also cleverly separated the enemy and gained an advantage. Sun Hao then ordered Tao Huang to take over as Jiaozhou Mu and started a long-term confrontation with the Western Jin Dynasty. After the Eastern Wu descended to the Jin Dynasty, Emperor Wu of Jin once wanted to take the opportunity to take back the Zhoumu and hold the heavy soldiers, but because Lin Yiguo often violated the border, the soldiers in Jiaozhou were not deleted in the end."}

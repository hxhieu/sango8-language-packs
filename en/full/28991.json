The military commander of the late Eastern Wu, Xuling governor and Jingzhou pastoralist. In the third year of Emperor Sun Hao's rebellion in Jiaozhou, Tao Jun led 7,000 soldiers to detour from the west to cope with the rebellion by his brother Tao Huang, who was then Jiaozhou Mu. When returning to Jingzhou, Tao Jun heard that the Jin Dynasty army was about to go south, so he transferred to Wuchang. After returning to Jianye to report on the military situation the following year, Tao Jun said that only 20,000 troops can be repelled. But the soldiers broke up when they reached the front, and Tao Jun's whereabouts were unknown afterwards."}

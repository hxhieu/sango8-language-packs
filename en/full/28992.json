{"id":28992,"original":"吳郡吳縣人，陸遜次子，孫吳後期名將。陸遜因被誣陷，抑鬱而亡後，陸抗為父辯白，還先父清白，更令孫權悔之莫及。曾上書孫皓，要求杜絕宦官弄權，以及治國、任人等多條諫言，可惜未被採納。陸抗為東吳後期抗晉主力，多次阻擾晉軍南犯。鎮壓後西陵督步闡叛變，為其最出名一役。而與晉朝大將羊祜各效其主，卻惺惺相惜的逸事，亦為千古佳談。","text":" A native of Wu County, Wu County, the second son of Lu Xun, a famous general in the late Sun Wu period. After Lu Xun was framed and depressed and died, Lu Kang pleaded for his father, and his father was innocent, which made Sun Quan even more regretful. He once wrote to Sun Hao, demanding that eunuchs should not be used to power, and many advices on governing the country and appointing people were not accepted. Lu Kang was the main anti-Jin force in the later period of the Eastern Wu, and repeatedly blocked the southern offenders of the Jin army. After the suppression, Xiling supervised the rebellion, his most famous battle. And the anecdote of Yang Hu, a general of the Jin Dynasty, who acted as his master, but sympathized with each other, is also an eternal talk."}

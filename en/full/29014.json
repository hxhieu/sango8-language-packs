He had followed Cao Cao during the period of the Lianjun. When Chen Gong rebelled against Cao and welcomed Lv Bu into Yan, Zaozhi held fast to Dong'a to protect him. In the first year of Jian'an, Cao Cao broke the Runan Yellow Turban Army and acquired a large number of cattle and farm tools. So Zaoyi wrote to recommend the implementation of the farming system. After a year of trial in Xudu, the historical record of 'Degu million hu' has filled the treasury. After the success of the farming method, Zaoyi suggested to implement the military training again, and Cao Cao should follow it. But soon after, Zaozhi died of illness. Many years later, Cao Cao still felt nostalgic for Zaozhi because of his work in farming the land and the friendship he followed in his early years."}

{"id":29025,"original":"曹魏將領，名字或為費曜。在曹真統督雍涼軍事時，奉命與張既、夏侯儒平定張進在酒泉的叛亂。曹丕稱帝後，西涼多有叛亂，費耀也跟隨刺史四處平亂，可說是當時雍涼重鎮，官拜後將軍。其後諸葛亮展開北伐，費耀更是多次參與阻擊蜀軍，但往往不敵諸葛亮與魏延。諸葛亮病逝五丈原後，史書上便再無費耀記載。","text":" General Cao Wei, whose name may be Fei Yao. When Cao Zhen commanded Yongliang's military affairs, he was ordered to quell Zhang Jin's rebellion in Jiuquan with Zhang Ji and Xiahouru. After Cao Pi became emperor, there were many rebellions in Xiliang, and Fei Yao followed the governor to quell the rebellion. It can be said that it was the important town of Yongliang at that time, and the official worshipped the general. After Zhuge Liang started the Northern Expedition, Fei Yao repeatedly participated in blocking the Shu army, but often lost to Zhuge Liang and Wei Yan. After Zhuge Liang died of illness in Wuzhangyuan, there is no longer any record of Fei Yao in history books."}

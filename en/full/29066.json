{"id":29066,"original":"太原祁人，曹魏大臣。年少時將家中物資全數捐出賑濟家鄉。之後成為地方官員，於曹操身邊當主簿時深受曹操的信賴，被任命揚州刺史。有見地、能料事，樊城之戰曾預言曹仁孤軍守城加上水勢高漲恐有危難；並在襄陽軍事告急時提醒裴潛應盡快整兵趕赴戰場。後調任涼州刺史，於赴任途中病逝，曹丕親發詔文哀悼。","text":" Taiyuan Qi people, Minister Cao Wei. When he was young, he donated all the materials in his home to help his hometown. Later, he became a local official, and was trusted by Cao Cao when he was the director next to Cao Cao. He was appointed as Yangzhou governor. Insightful and predictable, the Battle of Fancheng predicted that Cao Ren's solitary army guarding the city and the rising water might be in danger; and when the Xiangyang military was in emergency, he reminded Pei Qian to rush to the battlefield as soon as possible. Later, he was transferred to Liangzhou governor, and died of illness on the way to the post. Cao Pi sent an edict to mourn."}

{"id":29072,"original":"濟陰定陶人，曹魏謀臣。曾先後效力袁紹、張楊，最終歸於曹操。有智計，陳壽將其與程昱、郭嘉、劉曄、蔣濟等人並稱為「世之奇士」。在曹操迎天子一事貢獻頗多，誘騙楊奉領天子到許昌，令曹操得以施行奉天子以令不臣的天下大計。劉備投曹期間，與郭嘉等人看出劉備必反，可見其亦有識人之能。又揣摩曹操之意，建議恢復古代五等封建制，此舉為曹氏日後篡漢舖墊基礎。後輔佐曹丕，對魏軍南征舉措多有諫言，言無不中。","text":"Jiyin Ding Taoren, Cao Wei Mouchen. He played for Yuan Shao and Zhang Yang successively, and finally belonged to Cao Cao. With wisdom, Chen Shou, together with Cheng Yu, Guo Jia, Liu Ye, and Jiang Ji, called him \"the wonders of the world.\" Cao Cao made a lot of contributions to the matter of welcoming the emperor, and tricked Yang Feng to lead the emperor to Xuchang, so that Cao Cao was able to implement the grand plan of worshiping the emperor and not being a minister. During the period when Liu Bei voted for Cao, he and Guo Jia and others saw that Liu Bei must be opposed, which shows that he also has the ability to know people. Trying to figure out what Cao Cao meant, it is recommended to restore the ancient fifth-class feudal system, which paved the way for the Cao family to usurp the Han in the future. Later, he assisted Cao Pi, who had many admonishments on Wei Jun's southern expeditions."}

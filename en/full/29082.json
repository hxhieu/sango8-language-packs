{"id":29082,"original":"平陽襄陵人，晉惠帝之后。以貌醜善妒聞名。弄權專政，亦是八王之亂禍因之一。於八王之亂時，被趙王司馬倫誅殺。但中國古代做史，往往將禍亂亡國之因歸咎女子，有失公允。若無晉武帝大封宗室在前，又豈會有諸侯王坐大之果？而賈南風雖善妒且德行有缺，但其亦提拔出身寒門卻有才的張華等人，與當時注重門第的風氣大異。賈南風掌權期間，史稱「海內晏然」，亦為西晉少有的繁華時期。西晉自盛而衰，終至五胡亡晉，實非一人之過。","text":" People from Xiangling, Pingyang, after Emperor Hui of the Jin Dynasty. Known for being ugly and jealous. The dictatorship of power is also one of the causes of the chaos of the Eight Kings. During the Eight Kings Rebellion, he was punishable by Zhao Wang Simalun. However, in ancient Chinese history, it is often unfair to blame women for disasters. If there is no Jin Wu Emperor's great clan in the front, how can there be the fruit of the princes sitting on the big? Although Jananfeng was jealous and lacking in virtue, but he also promoted Zhang Hua and others who were born in a poor family but talented, which was very different from the prevailing attitude at that time. During the period of Jia Nanfeng in power, he was called \"Hainai Yanran\" in history, and it was also a rare prosperous period in the Western Jin Dynasty. The Western Jin Dynasty declined from its prosperity to the fall of the Five Hus in the Jin Dynasty."}

His real name is Zhao Jia. Because of several satires with his brother Zhao Xi, Tang Xuan, the brother of Chang Heng, was decimated and changed his name to escape. Later, he was conscripted as the governor of the state, and was exempted from office because of his involvement in the second party confinement. Although he went on to serve again later, the world was in chaos at the end of the Han Dynasty, and finally, when Liu Biao was an envoy for Emperor Xian, he stayed in Jingzhou because of his age. Zhao Qi is a well-known scholar of Confucian classics. He once wrote an annotation to \"Mencius\", from which Mencius's name \"Sub Sage\" comes from."}

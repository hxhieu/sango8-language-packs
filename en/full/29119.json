When Ma Chao broke into chaos for the second time, many counties in Longyou responded and fell after hearing the wind. Yang Fu, Zhao Ang and others pretended to be Ma Chao, and Ma Chao took Zhao Yue, Zhao Ang's son, as the host. Later Yang Fu, Zhao Ang and others saw that Ma Chao's vigilance gradually faded. They closed the city gate while the horse was out of the city, refused to overtake the city, and stayed there for more than a month until Xia Houyuan led his army and Ma Chao retreated. But Zhao Yue was killed by Ma Chao. During this period, Zhao Ang, Wang Yi and his wife had a great success in quelling the Ma Chao chaos."}

When I was young, I met with Zuti. The allusion of \"Wearing a Chicken and Dancing\" came from the two. At the end of the Western Jin Dynasty, the Rebellion of the Eight Kings also happened during the Five Husbands. The Jin Dynasty went to the south, but Liu Kun fought against the Hus in Jinyang in the north. However, his military and political talents were insufficient, and he did not make good use of people to accept advice, and ultimately failed. Liu Kun is also good at music, poetry and prose, all of which are famous in the world."}

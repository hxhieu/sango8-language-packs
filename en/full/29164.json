The teacher Sima Hui and his elder brother Liu Wangzhi worked for Liu Biao. After Liu Biao killed Liu Wang, Liu Yu went to Cao Cao's command, which was appreciated by Cao Cao and Cao Pi. Later, because his brother Liu Wei had a good relationship with Wei Satire, when Wei Satire rebelled, Liu Wei also participated, and Liu Yu was implicated. But because Liu Wei had persuaded Liu Wei to alienate Wei Yan before, he was pardoned by Cao Cao."}

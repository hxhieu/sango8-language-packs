{"id":29177,"original":"沛國相縣人，曹操部屬。因勸降袁術部將戚寄和秦翊，被任為揚州刺史。在任期間安輔賊寇，推屯田，廣興學，令境內大安，又修築合肥城，囤積戰備物資。日後孫權攻合肥鎩羽而歸，劉馥功不可沒。《三國演義》為醜化曹操，稱劉馥指出《短歌行》詞句不祥，而被曹操一槊刺死。","text":"Peiguoxiang County, Cao Cao's subordinate. Because of persuading Yuan Shubu to surrender Qi Ji and Qin Yi, he was appointed as Yangzhou governor. During his tenure, he assisted the bandits, promoted farmland, and prospered school, so that Daan in the territory built Hefei City and stocked war preparations. In the future, Sun Quan attacked Hefei and returned unwillingly, and Liu Fu contributed a lot. \"The Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" is a uglier of Cao Cao, claiming that Liu Fu pointed out the ominous words and phrases in \"Dan Ge Xing\" and was stabbed to death by Cao Cao."}

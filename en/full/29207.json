Originally a confidant general of Zhuge's birth, he had military exploits. When Zhuge Dan rebelled against Wei, Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi persuaded Zhuge Dan to take advantage of the solid hearts of the people, and the soldiers thought about their use, and tried to die. By attacking one side, they would surely break through the siege instead of sitting in a trap. But Zhuge refused to follow her birth, and even wanted to kill Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi, so the two took the opportunity to turn to Wei. In the battle of Jin and Wu, Jiang Ban also fought, defeating Dan Yang Rui, led by General Sun Wu and Shen Ying."}

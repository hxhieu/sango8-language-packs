Talented as both civil and military, Chen Shou wrote 'Three Kingdoms' and listed it with Guo Jia and Cheng Yu. Jiang Ji repeatedly commented on military affairs and pointed out that Chen's gains and losses were all at the heart of the matter. Therefore, he won the trust of the three generations of Cao and his sons, and he was Cao Wei's humeral minister. During the change of Gao Pingling, Jiang Ji wrote to persuade Cao Shuang to surrender, but after Cao Shuang surrendered, he was killed by Sima Yi.

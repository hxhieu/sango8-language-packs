{"id":29223,"original":"東吳將領。孫權晚年迷信，又有感於東吳人口稀缺，遂遣將軍衛溫、諸葛直率甲士萬人出海尋找夷洲及亶洲。因路途遙遠、疫病死者十之八九，最後未能找到亶洲，僅帶回了數千夷洲人。孫權認為衛溫和諸葛直違詔無功，下獄誅殺。","text":" Soochow generals. Sun Quan was superstitious in his later years, and felt that the population of Soochow was scarce, so he sent generals Wei Wen and Zhuge outright to find Yizhou and Bozhou. Nine out of ten people died due to the long distance and the epidemic. In the end, they could not find Qizhou and only brought back thousands of Yizhou people. Sun Quan believed that Wei Wen and Zhuge had violated the edict for nothing and went to jail."}

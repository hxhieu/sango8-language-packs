{"id":29251,"original":"范陽涿人，曹魏官員，大儒盧植之子。規鑒清理。魏明帝時曾參與修法，制法重情理，而不用嚴刑峻罰，但務須嚴明，「法宜一正，不宜有兩端」。選舉亦與曹操「唯才是舉」不同，先舉性行，而後言才。成語「畫餅充飢」的典故出自其與魏明帝對答。","text":"Fan Yangzhuo, Cao Wei official, son of Lu Zhi. Regulations clean up. Emperor Wei Ming participated in the revision of the law, and the law was made with reason and without severe penalties, but we must be strict and clear. 'The law should be straightforward, and there should be no two ends.' Election is also different from Cao Cao's 'only talents are selected,' in that they first act on the nature and then talk about the talent. The allusion to the idiom 'painting cakes to satisfy your hunger' comes from the answer to Emperor Wei Ming."}

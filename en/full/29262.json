Ren Wucheng's outstanding governance performance was appreciated by Sun Quan. After the death of Ling Tong, he inherited his trilogy, followed by Lu Xun in the battle of Yiling to fight against the Shu army; and repelled Cao Ren in the third battle of Ruxukou. He was then promoted to Supervisor. In addition to military performance, he is also acclaimed by people of the time for his straightforward rhetoric and admonition."}

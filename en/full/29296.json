His father Han Dang was one of the twelve tiger officials in Jiangdong, and Han Dang inherited his official titles and tribes after his death. Sun Quan ordered him to serve as the prefect of Wuchang, but he did not behave properly and repeatedly violated the ban. However, Sun Quan was grateful for Han Dang's merits and never pursued him.

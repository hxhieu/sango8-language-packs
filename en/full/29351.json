After the Rebellion of the Eight Kings, the Central Plains withered and the people's livelihood declined. Wang Yan was in the high position of San Gong but did not think about the economy. He only wanted to protect himself. Before the Rebellion of Yongjia, he was taken prisoner by Zhao Shile. Shi Le talked with him, and Wang Yan tried his best to tell himself that he was very talkative and did not ask about world affairs. Shi Le said angrily:  'The king's name covers the whole world, and he holds a heavy responsibility, and the young and strong go to the court. As for the white head, why should not hesitate the evil of the world! It is the sin of the king to destroy the world.' He decided to execute Wang Yan. In addition, the idiom 'spontaneous' comes from Wang Yan."}

{"id":29398,"original":"為演義所杜撰，取自道教對莊子之封號「南華真人」。莊子被尊為南華真人，最早可追溯至東晉末的《太極真人敷靈寶齋戒威儀諸經要訣》。《三國演義》第一回中，贈與張角《太平要術》者，即自稱為南華老仙。演義雖用其號，但大多認為並非暗指莊周。","text":"Composed by the Romance, taken from the title of 'Nanhua Zhenren' given to Zhuangzi by Taoism. Zhuangzi is revered as a real person in Nanhua, and can be traced back to the 'Tai Chi Real Person Fu Lingbao Fast Precepts and Prestige Keys' in the late Eastern Jin Dynasty. In the first episode of 'The Romance of the Three Kingdoms', the person who gave Zhang Jiao 'Tai Ping Yao Shu' is called Nanhua Lao Xian. Although the title is used in Romance, most of them think that it is not an allusion to Zhuang Zhou."}

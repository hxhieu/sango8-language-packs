{"id":29408,"original":"范陽郡逎縣，東晉北伐名將。「聞雞起舞」是其與劉琨之逸事。於永嘉之禍期間率眾南遷，上書晉元帝司馬睿，力請北伐，但司馬睿專注於鞏固帝位，敷衍了事。而後祖逖自募士卒、開爐鑄兵，渡江北伐，數度大敗後趙石勒，收復黃河以南多數土地。石勒忌憚祖逖，不敢南犯，更修書求好通商，邊防暫時和平。但晉元帝派不熟軍事的文官戴淵任征西將軍，以節制祖逖，又放任王敦和劉隗於朝中對立。祖逖眼見外不能抗敵，而內亂將起，激憤成疾，病死於雍丘。","text":"Fanyang County Dixian, a famous general in the Eastern Jin Dynasty and Northern Expedition. \"Smell the chicken and dance\" is an anecdote between him and Liu Kun. During the disaster in Yongjia, he led the people to move south and wrote to Sima Rui, the emperor of Jin and Yuan Dynasty, and urged the Northern Expedition, but Sima Rui focused on consolidating the emperor's position and did nothing. After that, Zuti recruited soldiers, opened furnaces and cast soldiers, crossed the river to the north, and after several defeats, Zhao Shile recovered most of the land south of the Yellow River. Shi Le was afraid of his ancestors and did not dare to commit a crime in the south. He even revised his book for good trade, and the border defense was temporarily peaceful. However, Dai Yuan, a civil servant who was unfamiliar with military affairs, was sent by the Emperor of Jin and Yuan to serve as General Zhengxi to control the ancestors, and let Wang Dun and Liu Wei stand in opposition in the court. Zu Ti couldn't resist the enemy when he saw the outside world, and the civil strife was about to rise, and he became ill and died of illness in Yongqiu."}

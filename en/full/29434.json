Together with Huangfusong, he defeated Zhang Jiao and killed Bu Si, Zhang Bo, Liang Zhongning and other Yellow Turban generals. However, because of the Han Ling Emperor's scourge of eradicating the eunuch, he was hated by Zhao Zhong, the attendant of the ten constant, and was framed by him and failed to be nominated. At that time, Liangzhou Xiqiang was in chaos, Zhao Zhonghe and a group of dignitaries who hated Fu Xie released him as the prefect of Hanyang. After Fu Xie took office, he was sympathetic to the people, and even the rebellious Qiang people surrendered. Then Han Sui rebelled and besieged Fu Xie in Hanyang. Han Suo led the Qiang people because of his gratitude for Fu Xie's kindness and couldn't bear to fight with him. They all knelt down and begged Fu Xie to surrender. His son Fu Gan also persuaded him to give up, but Fu Xie refused and died in battle. Fu Xie was loyal and courageous, but he was not allowed to reuse it. In the end, he gave birth to benevolence."}

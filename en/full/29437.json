When Cao Cao settled Guanzhong, due to the vacancy of the prefect of Hanxing, Zhang recommended You Chu as the prefect, and then transferred to the prefect of Longxi. You Chu is generous, he has always been in charge, and he is governed by kindness and is not easy to torture, so he is very popular. When Zhuge Liang's first Northern Expedition was unstoppable, the army and the people of Longxi were united and it was difficult to attack. In the end, the reinforcements of Cao Wei arrived and the Shu army could only escape."}

After Liu Zhang returned to Liu Bei, he was moved to Jingzhou. Guan Yu was defeated and Jingzhou was captured by Sun Wu, and Liu Zhang and Liu Chan's father and son changed to Soochow. Liu Chan successively served as Yizhou governor and Yushi Zhongcheng. When Yongkai rebelled against Shu, he also served as Jiaozhou governor. He was obviously not incompetent."}

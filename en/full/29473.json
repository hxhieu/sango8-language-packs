{"id":29473,"original":"汝南南頓人，少篤學，博覽多聞，精於律令儀典，又為《漢書》作注成《漢書集解音義》。任泰山太守時，曾大破三十餘萬黃巾軍。後因曹操父曹嵩返鄉途經泰山郡時被陶謙劫殺，恐曹操問罪，棄官投奔袁紹。","text":"A native of Runan Nandun, who is less devoted to learning, has a lot of knowledge, and is good at rituals and ceremonies. He also annotated the \"Han Shu\" into \"Han Shu Ji Yin Yi\". When he was Taishan prefect, he once broke more than 300,000 Yellow Turbans. Later, because Cao Cao's father Cao Song was robbed and killed by Tao Qian when he was passing through Taishan County, he abandoned the official to turn to Yuan Shao, fearing that Cao Cao would ask the crime."}

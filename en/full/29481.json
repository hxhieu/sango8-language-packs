Guan Xing's son died young, and Guan Yi inherited the Marquis of Hanshouting. Historically, Pound’s son Pang Hui followed Deng Ai and Zhong Hui to attack Shu. When Chengdu fell, Guan Yu’s line was lost to the Yis, which seemed to imply that Pang would avenge Guan Yu’s killing of Pound in the past."}

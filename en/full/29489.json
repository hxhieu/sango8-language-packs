{"id":29489,"original":"最早見於清朝張澍《諸葛忠武侯文集》，乃孟獲之子。但此書並非正史，內容多為杜撰子虛烏有之事。書中稱劉禪子劉恂不願移居洛陽，與關索等人南逃。後諸葛瞻之子諸葛質出使南中，與孟虬聯絡，孟虯接納劉恂，讓他住在永昌。","text":" It was first seen in the Collected Works of Zhuge Zhongwuhou by Zhang Shu in the Qing Dynasty, the son of Meng Huo. But this book is not official history, and the content is mostly fabricated. The book stated that Liu Chan's son Liu Xun was unwilling to move to Luoyang and fled south with Guan Suo and others. Later Zhuge Zhan's son Zhuge went to Nanzhong and contacted Meng Qiu. Meng Qiu accepted Liu Xun and let him live in Yongchang."}

{"id":29506,"original":"九真軍安人，又稱趙貞娘。學界多認為其人其事乃子虛烏有，因提及趙貞娘的史書多為地方志，且最早可考紀錄與其相隔千餘年。相傳趙貞娘與兄長一同起義反抗孫吳，多次打敗吳軍，更殺死交州刺史，令交趾、九真二郡震動，多有響應。後東吳派名將陸胤任交州刺史，率八千名吳軍鎮壓起義。趙貞娘走投無路，在松山自殺。後世越南人視趙貞娘為民族英雄，有「越南聖女貞德」美譽。","text":"Jiuzhen Jun'an, also known as Zhao Zhenniang. Academia often thinks that his people and things are fictitious, because most of the history books mentioning Zhao Zhenniang are local chronicles, and the earliest testable record is more than a thousand years away from it. Legend has it that Zhao Zhenniang and her elder brother rebelled against Sun Wu, defeating Wu Jun many times, and even killed Jiaozhou governor. This shocked Jiaozhi and Jiuzhen counties and responded to them. Later, the famous general of the Soochow Wu sent Lu Yin as the governor of Jiaozhou and led eight thousand Wu Jun to suppress the uprising. Zhao Zhenniang desperately committed suicide in Songshan. Later generations of Vietnamese regarded Zhao Zhenniang as a national hero, and she was known as \"Vietnamese Joan of Arc\"."}

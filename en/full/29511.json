The descendants of Maudun Shanyu in the Western Han Dynasty had intermarried with the Han royal family for generations, so their Han surname was Liu. Liu Yuan was smart and studious when he was young, read classics extensively, and was adept at bowing horses. During the Jin Dynasty as a proton, he was favored by Sima Zhao and Sima Yan. However, because he was worried that Liu Yuan was \"not my race, his heart would be different.\" He was afraid that he would rebel against Jin and was not reused. After the Eight Kings Rebellion broke out in the Western Jin Dynasty, Liu Yuan sent his troops to respond to Chengdu Wang Simaying. After the Chengdu King was defeated and lost, he supported his soldiers and respected himself."}

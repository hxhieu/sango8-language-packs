{"id":29514,"original":"《史記》中司馬遷載其為項羽身邊美人，常伴項王左右，名虞。一說姓虞。垓下之戰，楚軍兵少食盡，漢軍及諸侯兵卒圍之數重。夜又聞四面楚歌，楚軍士氣低迷，再無一戰之力。項羽英雄末路，乃感慨悲歌「垓下歌」，虞姬隨之唱和，帳中親隨將士，聞歌無不泣涕。後項羽率麾下壯士八百餘人，突圍至烏江畔，因無顏見江東父老，乃自刎而死。而虞姬下落，亦隨項王之死闕如杳然，無人知曉。後世文人與劇作，多稱虞姬自殺殉情，更將其與白娘子、孟姜女、王寶釧並稱四大情女。","text":"In 'Historical Records', Sima Qian described him as a beauty around Xiang Yu, often accompanied by King Xiang and named Yu. One said the last name is Yu. In the Battle of Gaixia, the Chu army ran out of soldiers, and the Han army and the princes surrounded them. Ye again heard the embarrassment on all sides, the morale of the Chu army was low, and there was no more power to fight. The end of Xiang Yu's hero is the sad song 'Gai Xia Ge,' and Yu Ji sings along with him. Later Xiang Yu led more than 800 strong men under his command and broke through to the bank of the Wujiang River. Because of his facelessness, he saw Jiangdong's elders and died of suicide. As for the whereabouts of Yu Ji, there is no one knows about the death of King Xiang. Later generations of literati and dramas often referred to Yu Ji's suicide and succumbing to her love, and even called her the four greatest mistresses along with Bai Niangzi, Meng Jiangnu, and Wang Baochuan."}

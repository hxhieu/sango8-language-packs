{"id":29515,"original":"自隋唐始設武廟祭祀姜子牙，關羽原為從祀之神，入列其中。兩宋時，或因話本興起，加之其時兩宋與遼、金、元的對立，關羽忠勇形象深入人心，民間供奉關羽的廟宇號稱「郡國州縣、鄉邑間井皆有」。其後歷代君王對關羽多有封賞，從此「侯而王，王而帝，帝而聖，聖而天」，迄今已為武聖。部分道教宗派甚至指稱天帝輪替，關羽乃當前玉帝。除道教信仰，關羽亦被天台宗的智者大師奉為伽藍菩薩。而隨漢文化遠播，日本、朝鮮，以及藏傳佛教亦崇拜關羽，關羽儼然成為東亞文化圈最受人景仰神祇之一。","text":"Since the Sui and Tang Dynasties, a martial arts temple was established to worship Jiang Ziya. Guan Yu was originally the god of worship and was included in it. In the two Song Dynasties, perhaps because of the rise of storytelling, coupled with the opposition between the two Songs and the Liao, Jin, and Yuan, Guan Yu's image of loyalty and courage was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The folk temples dedicated to Guan Yu are known as \"prefectures, prefectures, prefectures, counties, and towns. Since then, the monarchs of successive dynasties have awarded Guan Yu many rewards. From then on, \"the king is the king, the king is the emperor, the emperor is the holy, and the holy is the sky.\" He has become a martial sage. Some Taoist sects even refer to the rotation of the Emperor of Heaven, and Guan Yu is the current Jade Emperor. In addition to Taoist beliefs, Guan Yu was also regarded as a Garan Bodhisattva by the wise master of Tiantai Sect. With the spread of Chinese culture, Japan, Korea, and Tibetan Buddhism also worship Guan Yu, and Guan Yu has become one of the most admired deities in East Asian cultural circles."}

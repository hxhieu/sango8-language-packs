{"id":72,"original":"《 外交 》上兵伐謀，其次伐交。在不足以武力征討之前，多一位敵人不如多交一位朋友；遠交近攻，避免腹背受敵，趁勢好好培植實力。","text":" \"Diplomacy\" went to war, and then went to diplomacy. Before there is not enough military force to conquer, it is better to make more friends than one more enemy; to make close and close attacks, avoid being attacked by the enemy, and take advantage of the situation to cultivate strength."}

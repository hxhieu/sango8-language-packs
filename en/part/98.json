{"id":98,"original":"　　　《 南鄉子·登京口北固亭有懷 》 辛棄疾　　　何處望神州。滿眼風光北固樓。　　　千古興亡多少事，悠悠。不盡長江袞袞流。　　　年少萬兜鍪。坐斷東南戰未休。　　　天下英雄誰敵手。曹劉。生子當如孫仲謀。","text":"\"Nanxiangzi·Dengjingkou Beiguting has a heart\" Xin Qiji 　　　 Where to look to China. Eyes full of scenery Beigu Building.　　　 How many things come and go through the ages, leisurely. The endless Yangtze River Gun Gun Stream.　　　 Ten thousand years old. Sit down and fight in the southeast.　　　 The heroes of the world are rivals. Cao Liu. Having children is like Sun Zhongmou."}
